Presupposing no prior knowledge of Latin or linguistics, students are provided with the background necessary to understand the history of Spanish. Short, easy-to-digest chapters feature numerous practice exercises and activities. Chapter 'Lead-in' questions draw comparisons between English and Spanish, enabling students to use their intuition about their native language to gain a deeper understanding of Spanish. Each chapter features further reading suggestions, an outline, and a summary. Highlighted key terms are collated in a glossary. Boxes on linguistic debates teach students to evaluate arguments and think critically about linguistics. Supporting online resources include Word files of all the practices and activities in the book and an instructor's manual featuring a sample syllabus, answer key to the practices and activities, sample exams and teaching suggestions. This book is ideal for a range of courses on the history of Spanish and Spanish linguistics.},

	abstract = {Data sparsity is a large problem in natural language processing that refers to the fact that language is a system of rare events, so varied and complex, that even using an extremely large corpus, we can never accurately model all possible strings of words. This paper examines the use of skip-grams (a technique where by n-grams are still stored to model language, but they allow for tokens to be skipped) to overcome the data sparsity problem. We analyze this by computing all possible skip-grams in a training corpus and measure how many adjacent (standard) n-grams these cover in test documents. We examine skip-gram modelling using one to four skips with various amount of training data and test against similar documents as well as documents generated from a machine translation system. In this paper we also determine the amount of extra training data required to achieve skip-gram coverage using standard adjacent tri-grams.},

	abstract = {This paper analyses the alternation between complement clauses with and without complementizer (syndetic and asyndetic), in historical Spanish (15th–18th century). While previous studies have shown that this syntactic alternation was regulated by the degree of integration of the clauses, its stylistic distribution is understudied. In this paper we investigate whether the syndetic/asyndetic alternation is governed by socio-stylistic factors (discourse traditions, audience and speaker design). The analysis of the data from the corpus CODEA+2015, is carried out by using regression models. Our results indicate that the selection of asyndetic complements was predicted by the type of audience (reactive style-shift), employed especially when addressing superiors. Also, asyndetic complements were favored by the use of deferential request verbs such as suplicar (‘to beg’) that represents the petitioner as an inferior (proactive style-shift). Furthermore, the stylistic choice for an asyndetic complement was determined at the sentential level (“micro” discourse traditions), when the writer is also the performer of the speech-act. Thus, we show that in choosing alternative variants, writers are concerned with expressing grammatical meanings but also social identity. Additionally, the diachronic analysis indicates that while the proactive style-shift effect grows stronger over time, the relevance of the reactive style-shift declines, showing that socio-stylistic predictors, similarly to linguistic predictors, can be affected diachronic fluctuations. Our paper evinces the relevance of a multidimensional and diachronic approach to the study of syntactic variation, demonstrating how a monolithic view of the textual dimension can hide fine-grained socio-stylistic effects.},

Higher concentrations produce an extensive lysis of the cells. The cytotoxic effects of Equinatoxin are inhibited by phospholipids, thus suggesting that its mechanism of action may be related to interactions with lipids or other charged components of cell membrane. The observed lack of in vivo activity against L1210 leukaemia presumably is due to poor systemic absorption of the protein and/or neutralization by serum factors.},

	abstract = {In its emergence as a paradigm for the study of language, sociolinguistic variation theory has evolved through simultaneous confrontation with various other ways of viewing language. Along with most other schools of linguistics, it has explicitly taken position against unscientific normative and prescriptive ideologies of language, but it has also carried on a rather subtler rivalry with certain methodologically more rigorous psycholinguistic traditions. Together with other ‘hyphenated’ branches of linguistics, it has had continuously to situate itself with respect to generative linguistics, but at the same time it has defended its own criteria and methods from attack by antiformalist sociolinguistics. These external debates are reflected in the most important issues within the field; in this chapter I review these highly interrelated isues in what I believe to be a coherent synthesis of the variation theory perspectives on data, method, theory, and the social insertion of linguistic science. I adopt a Habermasian, critical theory approach to understanding:the social interests underlying linguistic research paradigmsthe origins of variation theory in colonialized and minority language communitiesthe type of data that must be accounted for in these communitiesthe particular kind of analytical problems and theoretical questions pertinent to these datathe epistemological status of a descriptive–interpretive methodology for dealing with the form–function problem – the central issue in the study of syntactic variation, with ramifications for all of these topics.},

	abstract = {The p-value has long been the figurehead of statistical analysis in biology, but its position is under threat. p is now widely recognized as providing quite limited information about our data, and as being easily misinterpreted. Many biologists are aware of p's frailties, but less clear about how they might change the way they analyse their data in response. This article highlights and summarizes four broad statistical approaches that augment or replace the p-value, and that are relatively straightforward to apply. First, you can augment your p-value with information about how confident you are in it, how likely it is that you will get a similar p-value in a replicate study, or the probability that a statistically significant finding is in fact a false positive. Second, you can enhance the information provided by frequentist statistics with a focus on effect sizes and a quantified confidence that those effect sizes are accurate. Third, you can augment or substitute p-values with the Bayes factor to inform on the relative levels of evidence for the null and alternative hypotheses; this approach is particularly appropriate for studies where you wish to keep collecting data until clear evidence for or against your hypothesis has accrued. Finally, specifically where you are using multiple variables to predict an outcome through model building, Akaike information criteria can take the place of the p-value, providing quantified information on what model is best. Hopefully, this quick-and-easy guide to some simple yet powerful statistical options will support biologists in adopting new approaches where they feel that the p-value alone is not doing their data justice.},

However, the longitudinal nature and the more constrained sampling of diachronic corpora present a number of challenges for historical linguists. One central problem that has received little attention is the periodization of a linguistic phenomenon P; that is, how the development of P over time can be divided into periods or stages. Because neither the year-by-year development of P nor the pre-defined historical periods distinguished by corpus compilers may be particularly meaningful or revealing for P, a bottom-up approach might be more appropriate for determining the stages of P’s development. However, this is difficult to accomplish using existing methods. This article describes a new clustering method, “Variability-based Neighbor Clustering” (VNC), to identify periods in the historical development of P that accounts for the temporal ordering of the data.},

            Over the last 20 or so years, research on syntactic alternations has made great
                    strides in both theoretical and methodological ways. On the theoretical side,
                    much of the research on syntactic alternations was restricted to generative
                    linguistics debating how near synonymous constructions differed slightly in
                    meaning and/or how one (and which one) was derived from the other
                    (transformationally). On the methodological side, much research consisted of
                    monofactorial studies based on relatively simple text counts. By now, however,
                    syntactic alternation research has become much more functional (in a broad sense
                    of the term) and much more methodologically sophisticated: Much work is now
                    motivated/interpreted psycholinguistically or in a broadly usage-based/cognitive
                    linguistic framework and much work has now adopted a regression-based analytical
                    strategy. These attractive developments notwithstanding, much remains to be done
                    and, in this paper, I sketch some recent developments in (largely) separate
                    alternation studies that I would like the field to adopt more broadly. These
                    developments can be heuristically grouped into ones that have to do with (i) the
                    statistical analysis of corpus-based and experimental alternation data, (ii) new
                    predictors that explain typically unexplored aspects of variability in

	abstract = {Romance texts translated from Latin – especially in the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance period – are supposed to contain numerous syntactic phenomena which can be explained as direct calques from the source text. Nevertheless, scholars often refer exclusively to this phenomenon ‒ i.e. the calque itself or Latinism ‒ when talking about Latinate constructions. Hence why other interesting related phenomena which are very significant in relation to the attitude adopted by the translator towards the syntax of the Latin text still remain almost neglected. Indeed, having an all-inclusive panorama of the syntactic possibilities available to the translator with regard to the original text also requires taking into account translational solutions other than the calque – Latinism –, which is the reason for the introduction of the terms Anti-Latinism, Hyper-Latinism, and Hetero-Latinism in my paper. The present study, based on a corpus of nine different 16th-century Romance translations – Spanish, Italian, French – of Erasmus’s dialogue Uxor mempsigamos, aims to verify the extent to which Latinate syntactic strategies are actually common in the translations under analysis as well as to check whether the reason for such strategies stems from the source text itself or they occur regardless of the latter.},

Linguistic variable (r) is a social differentiator in all levels of New York city speech and that rapid and anonymous speech events could be used as the basis for a systematic study of language. The advertising and price policies of the stores are very clearly stratified. Perhaps no other element of class behavior is so sharply differentiated in New York city as that of the newspaper which people read; many surveys have shown that the Daily News is the paper read first and foremost by working-class people, while the New York Times draws its readership from the middle class. The principal stratifying effect upon the employees is the prestige of the store, and the working conditions. Wages do not stratify the employees in the same order. The normal approach to a survey of department store employees requires that one enumerate the sales people of each store, draw random samples in each store, make appointments to speak with each employee at home, interview the respondents, then segregate the native New Yorkers, analyze and resample the nonrespondents, and so on.},

	abstract = {In this chapter, we use a fairly liberal definition of “grammatical variation,” including both genuinely variationist research – where grammatical variants are modeled as competing against each other – and text-linguistic research that explores variable text frequencies of particular grammatical constructions in corpora. Corpus-based research on grammatical variation is a wide research area, so the review we are offering is somewhat selective. By and large, research along these lines can be categorized into five groups: Variationist sociolinguistics. Researchers in this tradition are typically interested in how linguistic variation is conditioned by language-internal and language-external factors. Although early studies largely relied on the researcher's personal notes taken while listening to the audio recordings, state-of-the-art work is usually based on corpora consisting of fully transcribed sociolinguistic interviews (see Tagliamonte 2007). The bulk of this literature is concerned with phonological variation; however, grammatical variation has been subject to study since at least the 1980s (Torres Cacoullos and Walker 2009a; MacKenzie 2013; Poplack and Dion 2009; Poplack and Tagliamonte 1996; Scherre and Naro 1991; Tagliamonte and Temple 2005; Travis 2007; Weiner and Labov 1983). Diachronic linguistics. In this department we find work exploring grammatical variation with regard to resultant grammatical change - short-term or long-term, completed or in progress - on the basis of historical corpora (Biber and Gray 2011; Gries and Hilpert 2010; Hinrichs and Szmrecsanyi 2007; Hundt 2004; Nevalainen 1996; Raumolin-Brunberg 2005; Taylor 2008; Wolk et al. 2013). Register/genre/text type analysis. Work in this tradition is often focused on lexis, but many studies include features that come within the remit of grammatical variation (e.g. Biber 1988; Biber and Finegan 1989; Hundt and Mair 1999). Some analysts are exclusively concerned with grammatical variation (see Grafmiller 2014; and the papers in Dorgeloh and Wanner 2010). The Longman Grammar (Biber et al. 1999) backs up its comprehensive grammatical description of English with information about text type variation.},

The approach is a sociolinguistic one and attention is paid to the role of social status in the use of these expressions in Late Middle and Early Modern English. It is shown that the frequencies of these expressions change from the fifteenth to the sixteenth centuries, and the same applies to the construction types in which they typically occur. Both the general use of I THINK and METHINKS as evidentiality markers as well as typical constructions differ from one social rank to the other. The gentry, including knights, esquires and gentlemen, use the evidential expressions I THINK and METHINKS more frequently than the nobility or the non-gentry, particularly the merchant rank. The non-gentry uses I THINK more frequently with zero-that complementation and as a parenthetic clause in clause-medial and final positions, which are interpreted as more grammaticalized uses. We can then say that sociolinguistic differences exist in the fifteenth- and sixteenth-century use of the pragmatic elements I THINK and METHINKS. There is also evidence that grammaticalization may proceed differently in different social groups.},

	abstract = {The analysis and theory developed in Zero Syntax is an important contribution to the understanding of Universal Grammar. The overriding theme is the notion that the availability and syntactic positioning of arguments is not a matter of chance but arises from laws governing the structure of lexical entries and from laws governing syntactic structures themselves. Along the way, Zero Syntax also examines issues of broad significance to current theoretical linguistic research in syntax and lexical semantics. Zero Syntax develops two main topics: a simple view of syntactic linking regularities that it defends in the domain of Experiencer predicates (predicates such as annoy), and a theory of syntactic constituency that involves two parallel modes of structural organization (one of which is the Cascade syntax). The theme that ties these issues together is the supposition that phonologically null (zero) morphology is present in structure, detectable through its syntactic and morphological consequences. The arguments inZero Syntax will be relevant to debates about such issues as empty elements in syntax and morphology, whether syntactic structures should be binary branching, the structure of double-object constructions, and whether verbs have multiple meanings related by lexical rules or abstract/general meanings that are ambiguated in particular constructions.

Linguistic variation is evident in all these sources, yet their exploitation has largely been carried out within the context of techniques which were a legacy of comparative reconstruction, in which the history of discrete languages was envisaged as a successive series of ‘states’ (in the case of the Romance languages, from Latin to the present day). Such an approach is now increasingly acknowledged to depend on a naively monolithic view of language, and in Romance Linguistics it has had a number of undesirable consequences.Latin as a stage in the history of RomanceIn the first place, and most seriously for our present purposes, ‘Latin’, however this term is to be understood more precisely, has largely been equated with the first state of Romanist enquiry. Histories of the Romance languages are still entitled and construed as ‘From Latin to modern Language X’.},

	abstract = {For the past forty years, linguistics has been dominated by the idea that language is categorical and linguistic competence discrete. It has become increasingly clear, however, that many levels of representation, from phonemes to sentence structure, show probabilistic properties, as does the language faculty. Probabilistic linguistics conceptualizes categories as distributions and views knowledge of language not as a minimal set of categorical constraints but as a set of gradient rules that may be characterized by a statistical distribution. Whereas categorical approaches focus on the endpoints of distributions of linguistic phenomena, probabilistic approaches focus on the gradient middle ground. Probabilistic linguistics integrates all the progress made by linguistics thus far with a probabilistic perspective. This book presents a comprehensive introduction to probabilistic approaches to linguistic inquiry. It covers the application of probabilistic techniques to phonology, morphology, semantics, syntax, language acquisition, psycholinguistics, historical linguistics, and sociolinguistics. It also includes a tutorial on elementary probability theory and probabilistic grammars.},

The study finds that speakers' knowledge of probabilistic grammatical choices can vary across different varieties of the same language and can be detected psycholinguistically in the individual. In three pairs of experiments, Australians and Americans responded reliably to corpus model probabilities in rating the naturalness of alternative dative constructions, their lexical-decision latencies during reading varied inversely with the syntactic probabilities of the construction, and they showed subtle covariation in these tasks, which is in line with quantitative differences in the choices of datives produced in the same contexts.},

Detailed studies of particular languages, including Akkadian, Israeli, Jarawara, and Pennsylvania German, are framed by R. M. W.

This theme can be distilled into three rather distinct claims: (1) iconic principles govern speakers' choices of structurally available options in discourse; (2) structural options that reflect discourse-iconic principles become grammaticalized; (3) grammatical structure is an iconic reflection of conceptual structure. After presenting numerous examples from the functionalist literature in support of the idea that iconicity is widespread in language, I argue that claim (1) is irrelevant to generative grammar; claim (2), if correct, poses no challenge to generative grammar, despite a widespread belief to the contrary; and claim (3) has literally been built into standard versions of generative grammar. I go on to discuss the implications of iconic relations in language for the autonomy hypothesis and, at a more speculative level, for the evolution of language.},

	abstract = {The style dimension of language variation has not been adequately explained in sociolinguistic theory. Stylistic or intraspeaker variation derives from and mirrors interspeaker variation. Style is essentially speakers' response to their audience. In audience design, speakers accommodate primarily to their addressee. Third persons -- auditors and overhearers -- affect style to a lesser but regular degree. Audience design also accounts for bilingual or bidialectal code choices. Nonaudience factors like topic and setting derive their effect by association with addressee types. These style shifts are mainly responsive -- caused by a situational change. Speakers can also use style as initiative, to redefine the existing situation. Initiative style is primarily referee design: divergence from the addressee and towards an absent reference group. Referee design is especially prevalent in mass communication.},

              When one form replaces another over time in a changing language, the new form does not occur equally often in all linguistic contexts. Linguists have generally assumed that those contexts in which the new form is more common are those in which the form first appears and in which it advances most rapidly. However, evidence from several linguistic changes (most importantly the rise of the periphrastic auxiliary
              do
              in late Middle English) shows that the general assumption is false. Instead, at least for syntactic cases, change seems to proceed at the same rate in all contexts. Contexts change together because they are merely surface manifestations of a single underlying change in grammar. Differences in frequency of use of a new form across contexts reflect functional and stylistic factors, which are constant across time and independent of grammar.},

	abstract = {The paper sketches a novel, usage-based framework – Diachronic Probabilistic Grammar (DPG) – to analyze variation and change in diachrony. The approach builds on previous work in the Probabilistic Grammar tradition (see, for example, Bresnan 2007; Bresnan and Ford 2010) demonstrating, based on converging experimental and observational evidence, that syntactic knowledge is to some extent probabilistic, and that language users have excellent predictive abilities. What takes center stage in the approach is how contextual predictors (such as, for example, the principle of end weight) constrain linguistic variation. DPG is specifically interested in the extent to which such probabilistic constraints are (un)stable in the course of time. To highlight the diagnostic potential of the DPG framework, the paper explores three case studies: the development of the alternation between non-finite and finite complementation in the Late Modern English period, recent changes in the genitive alternation in the late 20th century, and a cross-constructional analysis of parallelisms in the development of the genitive and the dative alternation in the Late Modern English period.},

Variation is studied by tapping into a number of independent variables, such as precedence of either construction in the text, length of the possessor and possessum phrases, phonological constraints, discourse flow, and animacy of the possessor. In addition to distributional analyses, we use logistic regression to investigate the probabilistic factor weights of these variables, thus tracking language change in progress as evidenced in the language of the press. This method, married to our large database, yields the most detailed perspective to date on frequently discussed issues, such as the relative importance of possessor animacy and end-weight in genitive choice (cf. most recently Rosenbach 2005), or on the exact factorial dynamics responsible for the ongoing spread of the

It is argued that by using such bivalency strategically, speakers and writers in contact zones create the effect of using two languages at once, and that this can be a political act. The texts examined here were composed to demonstrate the superiority of the Spanish language and thus to support Spanish political preeminence.

	abstract = {This study applies multinomial regression analysis to a parallel corpus of Spanish medieval translations of the Bible in order to study the different factors that condition variation in the expression of possession in Old Spanish. Our methodology allows us to determine the degree to which less frequent possessive constructions (ART + POSS, as in la su casa 'the his house'; GEN, as in la casa de él 'the house of him'; and ART/BARE, as in la casa 'the house') can be considered competitors to the dominant POSS construction (as in su casa 'his house') as a function of usage context differences. In comparison to the POSS construction, the ART + POSS construction usually expresses pragmatic functions such as reverence, the GEN construction is typically used to disambiguate a reference, and the ART/BARE construction is bound to contexts in which the possessor is highly accessible. Crucially, the analysis also sheds light on historical changes in the balance between structural and contextual constraints on the use of these different variants. Whereas in the 13th century, structural and stylistic constraints are almost equally important, the importance of structural constraints diminishes in the 15th century. The study thus illustrates how in reductive processes of language change, variation due to structural constraints yields to stylistic variation.},

Generalizations (in the form of laws) about the relationships between these states may then be made, and more recently the specification of ‘possible’ and ‘impossible’ processes of change has been seen as an important theoretical goal.},

Distinguishing between the gender of the author, speaker, \& addressee of the texts, four language usage generalizations are tested: (1) in mixed-gender settings, women speak less than men; (2) women are more focused on personal \& interactional aspects of conversation, whereas men focus more on transferring information; (3) women's styles tend to be more tentative; \& (4) women use more narrative strategies, whereas men use more persuasive strategies. Testing methods include proportional word counts \& multidimensional analyses as developed by Douglas Biber (1988). Whereas generalizations (2) \& (4) are found to be supported, it is observed that the nature of the interactional dyad (ie, same vs mixed gender) appears to be as strong a predictor as the gender of character or author, especially in 20th-century drama. 2 Tables, 7 Figures, 22 References.

	volume = {13},
	issn = {1613-7027},
	abstract = {In Dutch, as in several other languages, many ditransitive verbs alternate between a construction with two unmarked NP objects coding the recipient and the theme (the double object construction, e. g. Hij gaf haar een geschenk ‘He gave her a present’) and a construction in which the recipient is marked by a preposition, viz. aan in the case of Dutch (the aan-construction, e. g. Hij gaf een geschenk aan zijn vrouw ‘He gave a present to his wife’). In this paper we take a diachronic and multifactorial perspective, both of which are lacking in the literature on the Dutch dative alternation. First, focussing on the dative alternation in early Modern Dutch, we show via a mixed-effects logistic regression model that, in the earliest period already, the alternation was determined by a cluster of semantic, formal and discourse-pragmatic factors. A comparison with a regression model for the late Modern English dative alternation (Wolk et al. 2013, Dative and genitive variability in Late Modern English: Exploring cross-constructional variation and change. Diachronica 30(3). 382–419) suggests that the cognitive mechanisms underlying a speaker’s choice for one of both ditransitive constructions hold cross-linguistically. Second, via a detailed diachronic comparison with a regression analysis for present-day Dutch, we show that through time a better correspondence seemed to emerge between the order of theme and recipient and the constructional choice. Word order principles more clearly play a role in the present-day alternation: the effects of several formal and discourse-pragmatic variables have become stronger, and the frequency of the non-canonical orders of both constructions has decreased.},

To this end, a database of 18th-century correspondence collections is being compiled in an open-access electronic journal, Historical Sociolinguistics and Sociohistorical Linguistics; additions to the corpus, which presently contains 73 authors, are invited. It is argued that the language of informal 18th-century letters can be identified as a written vernacular; criteria for the classification of a letter in this category include the presence of corrections, obvious violations of current linguistic norms, a close relationship between writer \& addressee, \& separate sheets intended for the latter's eyes only - to be removed before circulating the letter around the drawing room. 110 References.

The aan-construction in 17th Century Dutch: A semasiological investigation

The Dutch aan-construction (e.g. Hij gaf een bos bloemen aan zijn vrouw ‘He gave a bouquet to his wife’), the prepositional alternative for the
double object construction (Hij gaf zijn vrouw een bos bloemen ‘He gave his wife a bouquet’), is a post Middle Dutch innovation (i.e. after 1500 AD). The precise details of the rise of the aan-construction remain, however, understudied. It is for example unclear whether
the construction really breaks through in the 17th century, as Weijnen and Gordijn (1970) argue on the basis of a small corpus of farces, and what its semantic range was in those early days. In this paper we try to shed more light on these issues. On the basis of a self-compiled corpus of
literary Dutch, we firstly show that the construction was not only already frequently attested in the language use in the 17th century, but also covered a remarkably wide semantic range at that time. Next, via a detailed comparison with data for the 20th century, we show that there have been
interesting changes concerning the semantic evolution of the aan-construction. The structural weight of a cluster of ‘do’- and ‘send’-verbs for example declines over time and at more general level there seems to be a trend towards more abstract uses of the aan-construction.
A diachronic collostructional analysis (Hilpert, 2006) and Configural Frequency Analysis (von Eye, 2002) lends a statistical underpinning to our observations.},

	abstract = {In the National Archives in Kew, London, a treasure is kept which is of great importance for the history of the Dutch language: a collection of seventeenth-century letters written by men and women from various social backgrounds. Given the fact that much of the linguistic research of seventeenth-century Dutch has been perforce based on printed texts and linguistic data produced by a relatively small number of upper-class – usually male – writers, not much is known with certainty about the everyday Dutch of seventeenth-century lower- and middle-class people. The letters hidden in the National Archives can change this. 
 
In this dissertation, a corpus of 595 letters written between 1664 and 1672 is examined from a sociolinguistic perspective. The topics treated are: forms of address, reflexivity and reciprocity, negation, schwa-apocope, diminutives, and the genitive and alternative constructions. The case studies show that there was still a lot of variation in seventeenth-century Dutch and that some linguistic changes had not progressed as far in the everyday Dutch of ‘ordinary’ people as previous research has suggested. Furthermore, it is shown that gender and social class are important factors of influence on the seventeenth-century language use, especially when interpreted in terms of education and writing experience.},

	abstract = {Any attempt to describe the present state of proverb scholarship and its desiderata for the ñiture must by necessity íook back upon past accomplishments. The interest in proverbs can, after all, be traced back to the earliest Sumerian cuneiform tablets and the philosophical writings of Aristotle. Renaissance scholars, such as Erasmus of Rotterdam, and modern folklorists, such as Archer Taylor, have all built on previous research as they put forth their own collections and studies of proverbs. There is indeed an impressive history of the two major aspects of proverb scholarship, i.e., the collection of proverbs (paremiography) and the study-of proverbs (paremiology). Naturally these two branches are merely two sides of the same coin, and some-of the very best research on proverbs combines the two in perfect harmony. Although the Identification of traditional texts as proverbs and their arrangement in collections of various types are of paramount importance, proverb scholars have always known that the interpretaron of their use in oral or written speech acís is of equal significance. The following remarks can only scratch the proverbial surface of the retrospective and prospective aspects of modern paremiology. Yet I will attempt to address some major issues of past, present, and future proverb research while giving representative examples of recent scholarship that can serve as rnodels for what lies ahead. My remarks are divided into three rnajor categories, i.e., (1) fundamental resources, such as special journals, essay volumes, and bibliographies dedicated to proverb research, (2) the status of extant proverb collections and the direction of paremiography in the future; and (3) the impressive results of 20th century proverb scholarship and a glimpse at the desiderata for paremiology as we enter the 21st century.},

            This squib discusses empirical challenges incurred by assuming cognitive reality as a defining feature of

					Specifically, it zooms in on the methodological challenges in identifying cognitively plausible constructions in historical data,
					in particular when taking a highly exploratory, bottom-up approach with very little pre-selection or pre-analysis. I illustrate
					this issue with the example of a current project on PPs in the history of English, and the various functions these have in
					combination with verbs (from prototypical adjuncts to complements). I argue that the constraints of historical data make it
					necessary to find different, new ways to determine which abstractions and distinctions are likely to have been represented in
					minds of historical language users, and to furthermore identify changes in constructional networks over time.},

However, while researchers agree that these results characterize grammar as an emergent phenomenon, there is no consensus among usage-based scholars as to how the various results can be explained and integrated into an explicit theory or model. Building on network theory, the current paper outlines a structured network approach to the study of grammar in which the core concepts of syntax are analyzed by a set of relations that specify associations between different aspects of a speaker’s linguistic knowledge. These associations are shaped by domain-general processes that can give rise to new structures and meanings in language acquisition and language change. Combining research from linguistics and psychology, the paper proposes specific network analyses for the following phenomena: argument structure, word classes, constituent structure, constructions and construction families, and grammatical categories such as voice, case and number.

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images ofobjects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

	abstract = {The fundamental distinction between the medial problem of 'phonic' vs. 'graphic' realisation of discourses, on the one hand, and the conceptional problem of their 'spoken = informal' vs. 'written = formal' character (denominated 'communicative immediacy' vs. 'distance' in the following) not only constitutes a sound theoretical basis for investigation into orality and literacy, but also leads to a better understanding of a wide range of synchronic and diachronic phenomena concerning language. The medial-conceptional distinction accounts, for example, for important problems on the level of discourse typology, comprising, for instance, 'elaborated' types of primary orality, communicative dynamics in medieval societies, modern types of electronic communication (e-mail, SMS message, chat), etc. Once it is to clearly tell the medial from the conceptional aspect of language, it is, of course, legitimate to observe the most interesting interactions between these two. The idea of a conceptional continuum between communicative 'immediacy' and 'distance' constitutes also an important contribution to variational linguistics and sociolinguistics. It can be shown that this continuum is not only one dimension of linguistic variation, but the central principle underlying the organisation of variational spaces (within one language) and of communicative spaces (involving more than one language). Moreover, the medial-conceptional distinction reveals to be of paramount importance to a modern conception of language history as observing the transformation of whole variational spaces. The questions that can be dealt with here comprise the way to literacy, processes of elaboration, Überdachung, standardization, codification, reorganization of variational spaces, etc. as well as several types of language change. Finally, a clear conceptualization of medial and conceptional problems is indispensable for a sound methodology in corpus linguistics.},

            This paper develops a corpus-driven analysis of wh-interrogatives in Castilian Spanish. Combining methods from variationist and interactional linguistics, it is demonstrated that both the distribution of the variants and their discourse functions can be described in terms of the degree of mental accessibility of the interrogative proposition (P) and the referent of the interrogative pronoun/ adverb (X). In contexts in which both P and X have a low degree of accessibility, wh-interrogatives establish a new Question under Discussion; in contexts in which P has a high and X a low degree of accessibility, wh-interrogatives are used to elaborate a current Question under Discussion; in contexts in which both P and X have a high degree of accessibility, wh-interrogatives are used to repeat, clarify or challenge a previous utterance. Given that the wh-interrogative variants differ in their restrictions regarding the accessibility of P and X, they typically also fulfil different discourse functions. The analysis moreover demonstrates that due to these functional differences, the type of response to the interrogatives produced by the listeners differs systematically depending on the wh-interrogative type.},

Situating this feature within its historical development and synchronic patterning, we seek to understand the mechanism underlying the choice between that and zero. Our findings reveal that, in contrast to the diachronic record, the zero option is predominant – 91 per cent overall. Statistical analyses of competing factors operating on this feature confirm that grammaticalization processes and grammatical complexity play a role. However, the linguistic characteristics of a previously grammaticalized collocation, I think, exerts a greater effect. Its imprint is visible in multiple internal factors which constrain the zero option in the other contexts. We argue that this recurrent pattern in discourse propels the zero option through the grammar. These findings contribute to research arguing for a strong relationship between frequency and reanalysis in linguistic change.},

Emergent Grammar is not so much a “new” theory of grammar as an attitude toward structure that is forced by the recognition that speech is eventive and temporal. Emergent Grammar can best be illustrated by considering a standard syntactic analysis of an English noun phrase. An English noun phrase within an interaction provides an example of the way that grammatical structure develops as an utterance proceeds. Much of the general strategy for creating a verbal interaction is an additive one.},

              Previous studies on the diachrony of
              wh
              -interrogation in Brazilian Portuguese have observed a replacement process of ex-situ-

              interrogatives by cleft-

              and in-situ-
              wh
              interrogatives in the twentieth century. The present study analyzes almost 19,000
              wh
              -interrogatives from a corpus of theater plays dated between 1800 and 2016, demonstrating that not all of these frequency changes constitute actual change. The increase in the usage frequency of several types of
              wh
              -interrogatives is partially or entirely due to changes in the degree of orality of theater plays, or changes in word order. Moreover, only some of these changes can be characterized as changes from below, that is, changes in which high-orality texts are affected by the frequency increase first. This notion is also relevant for functional change in
              wh
              -interrogatives. Over time, the use of cleft-
              wh
              and in-situ-
              wh
              interrogatives spread from contexts in which the proposition is highly accessible to low-accessibility contexts. For cleft-
              wh
              , this change is moderated by orality, again indicating change from below.},

(i) Structural constraints are lost in the diffusion of the New York City pattern of tensing short-a to four other communities: northern New Jersey, Albany, Cincinnati, and New Orleans.

            The present contribution starts from the general observations (i) that the study of text varieties has commonly emphasized the mode (speech vs. writing) as an essential variable and (ii) that linguistic analyses increasingly consider performed language (i.e., fictional scripted material as represented in telecinematic language and lyrics, for instance) as an object worth studying in its own right. It is recognized (i) that assessing performed language in terms of the traditional spoken-written dichotomy fails due to a number of inherent properties of relevant text varieties and their circumstances of production and reception, and (ii) that schemes applied within conventional (bottom-up) register perspectives may not be fully adequate for a text-linguistic approach toward performed language either. Koch and Oesterreicher’s communicative model (KOM), which takes account of contextual factors as well as of specific linguistic strategies and establishes a continuum between the language of distance and the language of immediacy, as well as three attempts at modifying KOM are introduced. It is argued that both KOM (as a top-down model) and its modifications have weaknesses when dealing with performed text varieties. An enhanced communicative model, including the dimensions synchronicity and authenticity, is sketched out, which could serve both as a starting point and complement for empirical investigations of textual variation whenever performed language is included.},

              Benedikt Szmrecsanyi, Professor of Linguistics in the Quantitative Lexicology and Variational Linguistics research
                    group at the Katholieke Universiteit (KU) Leuven, writes this article exploring the connections between register and variationist
                    linguistics. He is involved with various large-scale research projects in areas such as probabilistic grammar, variationist
                    sociolinguistic research, linguistic complexity, and dialectology/dialectometry. Szmrecsanyi’s books include

                    English and Dutch’, a project aimed at exploring the question of whether register differences lead to differences in the processes
                    of making linguistic choices. In sharp contrast to the status quo in variationist linguistics, where register is often ignored

	abstract = {This paper describes the address system in the Spanish of the end of 16th and the beginning of 17th centuries and tries to give an interpretation of this system on the basis of works such as Brown and Gilman (1960), Lakoff (1973, 1977, 1979), Brown and Levinson (1978, 87), Hill et al. (1986) and Ide (1989). The data has been extracted from a corpus of several plays from the Spanish Golden Age. Speakers of Spanish from this period choose among three different pronouns: TÚ, VOS and VUESTRA MERCED. In this paper, we observe all dyads that occur in the selected corpus, and describe how they usually work on the basis of the two following variables: power and intimacy. First, analyzing how society expects address to be between two particular interactants is important to us. The description of these expectations is the description of the socially encoded polite rules of the period, which coincides with Ide's definition of discernment (see Hill et al., 1986). However, we also have to bear in mind that in some interactional situations, the speakers choose their address pronouns according to the volitional aspect of politeness, because showing affection, solidarity or some kind of emotion to the addressee is more important to the speaker than following the socially encoded rules. Many usages of pronouns are even due to momentary emotional situations between the speaker and the hearer. The choice of the pronoun becomes a game with a strategy to get certain objectives from the hearer or to show certain feelings towards the hearer. The differentiation between two different aspects of politeness; discernment and volition, introduced by Hill et al. (1986) for Japanese, can also be applied to the study of Spanish Golden Age address system. According to Brown and Gilman (1960), until the 19th century, power semantics prevailed. However, according to the data extracted from our corpus, we can move back the date when solidarity semantics starts to work in Spanish. It seems that in Spanish both solidarity semantics and power semantics are working simultaneously, but applied to different interactional contexts.},

	title = {Token-based vector space models as semantic control in lexical lectometry},
	url = {https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/549451},
	abstract = {Type-based distributional semantics as embodied in vector space models has proven to be a successful method for the retrieval of near-synonyms in large corpora. These words have then been used as variants of lexical sociolinguistic variables (e.g.: return and winst for the concept profit) in lectometric studies, that is, the aggregate-level study of lexical distances between linguistic varieties, in particular pluricentric languages such as Dutch. However, a limitation of type-based vector space models is that all senses of a word are lumped together into one vector representation, making it harder to control for polysemy and subtle contextual distinctions. In addition, operating at the lexeme level, these type-based vector space models are not able to pick out the relevant corpus occurrences that are the input for the lectometric distance calculations. The main goal of this PhD project is to introduce token-based vector space models in lexical lectometric research, in order to gain better semantic control during the composition of lexical variables. Token-based vector space models address the abovementioned shortcomings by disambiguating different senses of lexical variants. This technique is able to model the semantics of individual tokens (i.e. 'usage occurrences') of a word in a corpus and to represent them as token clouds in multidimensional vector space, with clusters of tokens revealing distinct senses of the word. By superimposing the token clouds of the lexical variants, one can distinguish which meanings are shared by near-synonyms and determine the 'semantic envelope of variation' of the lexical alternation. For instance, the variant return is polysemous in Netherlandic Dutch, with the two readings 'profit' and 'return game', but not in Belgian Dutch, where only the 'profit' sense is found. By isolating the cluster of tokens with the meaning 'profit' one can identify the near-synonymous tokens of the variants winst and return. The fine-tuning of vector space model-based lectometry targeted in this PhD contributes to the scaling up of lexical variationist research, by providing methods for dealing with corpora whose size exceeds manual analysis. At the same time, token-based models comply with the need of detailed analysis by allowing to zoom in on the behavior of individual tokens in order to determine more subtle contextual distinctions. This PhD project is situated in a larger research endeavor ("Nephological Semantics - Using token clouds for meaning detection in variationist linguistics", BOF C1 project 3H150305) that aims at detailed understanding of token-based vector representations for lexical, semantic and variational research.},

In addition, the behavior of manner-of-speaking that-clauses patterns with noun complement clauses and that-clauses following the pronoun it. In this paper, I argue that the referential and adjunct status of manner-of-speaking that-clauses, noun complement clauses and that-clauses following the pronoun it is responsible for their shared restrictions on wh-extraction, main clause phenomena and complementizer drop. Specifically, I argue all three of these that-clauses are referential adjuncts in a close apposition relationship with a nominal object.},

              Using quantitative corpus evidence from different periods, the present article analyzes the emergence and diachronic development of
                    the Spanish time constructions (clausal and adverbial) involving contemporary
              hacer
              ‘make’ and earlier
              haber
              ‘have’. The obtained data, as well as cross-linguistic evidence, suggest that the clausal construction
                    must have been the source of the adverbial one. A proposal is presented that could explain that development. The data show, in
                    addition, that the grammatical properties and usage patterns of the clausal and adverbial constructions were very similar until
                    the 16th century but have been diverging ever since. This divergence coincides with an exponential increase in the textual raw
                    frequency of the adverbial construction, where word order fixation, erosion of the inflectional morphology and a change in the
                    possibilities for time adjunction among others are found to occur at around the same time. This points towards a
                    desentencialization, loss of inner structure and grammaticalization of the adverbial construction in those periods.},

Se muestra cómo este nuevo ACI (relacionado con las cláusulas de percepción y las factitivas pero con distintos constituyentes) no fue un fenómeno efímero, sino que se mantuvo en los textos durante tres siglos e incluso pudo tener efectos modificadores en la sintaxis del sistema de complementación con infinitivos del español. Los estudios existentes acerca de los latinismos bajomedievales no han prestado suficiente atención a este esquema, que puede relacionarse con otras tendencias de la sintaxis áurea como la supresión del que completivo.},

	abstract = {Blending is generally seen as a marginal source of linguistic innovations in language change. However, the impact of blending is likely underestimated, because blends may occur under the guise of analogical extension. In such cases, blending is covert and cannot be detected synchronically in the innovative structure. In this paper, the relation between analogy and blending is analyzed. Next, the role of covert blending is demonstrated in two diachronic case studies. The first case study addresses the use of the English verbs want and need in the Passival Participle Construction (e.g. you need your eyes testing). The pattern could have analogically extended from perception verbs, as claimed by Visser (1963–1973), but distributional, chronological and semantic evidence indicate that the extension happened through blending between two other constructions, the Passival Gerund Construction (your eyes need testing) and the Object Complement Construction (you need your eyes tested). The second case study deals with the development of the Dutch downtoner allesbehalve (‘not at all’). It is shown that once allesbehalve had adopted the syntactic status of a downtoner it spread to new syntactic contexts. Since this brings allesbehalve in line with other downtoners, the process can be seen as an instance of analogical extension. Quantitative evidence, however, shows that the developing syntactic behaviour of the downtoner continues to be influenced by the syntax of its composing elements, alles (‘everything’) and behalve (‘except’). Change is thus partly driven by blending between the downtoner and its own historical source. In both cases, apparent analogical extensions hide an underlying blend. These findings show that blending may be more pervasive than generally recognized, supplementing rule-based strategies for coining new utterances.},

The identification of ‘learne`d’ syntactic features is especially problematic in the Romance languages, where Latin is both the lending and the parent language. In this article, I examine one case of learnéd syntactic influence which interestingly also suffers demise, and show that the many factors involved its rise and fall preclude a simplistic account of learnéd influence as mere imitative borrowing; they also shed light on the role of structural congruency in such influence and the apparent paradox that a construction can be favoured in one period and abandoned in another.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the diachrony of complementizer omission (C-omission) in some Italian clauses. C-omission is restricted to clauses with [-realis] mood in Old as well as in Modern Italian, and to some types of declarative clauses in Modern Florentine (Cocchi \& Poletto, 2005). This phenomenon is instead much more pervasive in the Renaissance period (Wanner 1981, Scorretti 1991) and invests basically all types of subordinate clauses. The present study concentrates on C-omission in Renaissance Italian relative clauses, which is attested in both subject and non-subject extractions. There is a subject/non-subject asymmetry in the frequency of C-omission in relative clauses, which is claimed to result from the combination of an active vs. inactive distinction that characterizes both Old and Renaissance Italian, and the loss of V-to-C. The active vs. inactive distinction is attributed to the presence of a strong (*) feature on the low-phase head, v*, in both Old and Renaissance Italian, while the loss of (*) in CP determines the loss of V-to-C in Renaissance Italian only. The argument is corroborated by further comparative facts from Old Occitan and Old French, as well as by a contrast with Old Portuguese and Old Spanish.},

            The present study investigates the cross-linguistic differences in the use of so-called T/V forms (e.g. French tu and vous, German du and Sie, Russian ty and vy) in ten European languages from different language families and genera. These constraints represent an elusive object of investigation because they depend on a large number of subtle contextual features and social distinctions, which should be cross-linguistically matched. Film subtitles in different languages offer a convenient solution because the situations of communication between film characters can serve as comparative concepts. I selected more than two hundred contexts that contain the pronouns you and yourself in the original English versions, which are then coded for fifteen contextual variables that describe the Speaker and the Hearer, their relationships and different situational properties. The creators of subtitles in the other languages have to choose between T and V when translating from English, where the T/V distinction is not expressed grammatically. On the basis of these situations translated in ten languages, I perform multivariate analyses using the method of conditional inference trees in order to identify the most relevant contextual variables that constrain the T/V variation in each language.},

Spanish provides an ideal test case for such a study: Spanish is a major international language with a long social history of literacy, and it is a Romance language, with interesting linguistic similarities to, and differences from, English. The present study uses Multi-Dimensional (MD) analysis to investigate the distribution of a large set of linguistic features in a wide range of spoken and written registers: 146 linguistic features in a twenty-million words corpus taken from nineteen spoken and written registers. Six primary dimensions of variation are identified and interpreted in linguistic and functional terms. Some of these dimensions are specialised, without obvious counterparts in the MD analyses of other languages (e.g., a dimension related to discourse with a counterfactual focus). However, other Spanish dimensions correspond closely to dimensions identified for other languages, reflecting functional considerations such as interactiveness, personal stance, informational density, argumentation, and a narrative focus.},

	abstract = {This study examines the role of distance in the decision among grammatical variants. The empirical test case is the English mandative subjunctive construction, which co-occurs with an embedded modal auxiliary, a subjunctive or an indicative verb form. The fact that the subjunctive is triggered by specific lexical items allows one to measure the distance between the triggering unit and the target verb. This distance is found to play a significant role in the grammatical decision process. With increasing distance between trigger and target, the probability of selecting a modal auxiliary increases and the probability of selecting the subjunctive decreases. The theoretical account hinges on the range and strength of linguistic units. Syntactic units (i.e. modals) are claimed to have a wider range than morphological units (i.e. indicative and subjunctive). Furthermore, the indicative is claimed to have a wider range than the subjunctive. Varying ranges are interpreted as varying decay rates. The lower decay rate of syntactic as compared to morphological units results from the syntactic level being superordinated to the morphological level in language production. The inclusion of the semantic and the phonological levels confirms that the position of a level in the structural hierarchy determines its range.},

Las introducciones históricas que acompañan a la mayoría de los resúmenes se quiere que cumplan un doble objetivo: por una parte mostrar esa otra parte de la historia que nunca se estudia (la historia de la ciencia, en particular de las matemáticas) y por otra, mostrar esta ciencia como algo vivo, en constante cambio, ya que da la impresión cuando se estudian matemáticas, que las propiedades, operaciones y problemas que estudia esta disciplina son “siempre los mismos”. Sin embargo, algo tan nimio y sin importancia para nosotros, como es el uso del cero, no comenzó a ser aceptado en Europa hasta el S. XIII, si bien los mayas lo usaban en el S. I a.C.

              Merja Kytö is Professor of English Language at Uppsala University. In this article, she provides a detailed
                    accounting of the role of register in research on the historical development of language. Her substantial body of work has focused
                    on both the historical development of specific registers, as well as how historical change has been mediated by register. Her
                    research has encompassed a range of time periods (from Early Modern English to the 19th century) and registers (for example,
                    depositions, Salem witchcraft records, and dialogues). Her many edited collections have brought historical linguists together into
                    comprehensive and rigorous volumes, including the
              Cambridge Handbook of English Historical Linguistics
              (
              Kytö \& Pahta 2016
              , Cambridge University Press),

                    a key contributor to the development of principled historical corpora, such as the
              Helsinki Corpus of English
                        Texts
              project, which represents a range of registers from Old and Middle English to Early Modern English. Merja Kytö
                    has long been a leader in demonstrating how systematic attention to register can result in rich profiles of historical
                    development, and in addressing the inherent challenges involved in utilizing historical documents for linguistic research.},

	abstract = {One of the most notable characteristics of grammatical morphemes (hereafter “grams”;) and the constructions in which they occur is their extremely high text frequency as compared to typical lexical morphemes. Since grams commonly develop from lexical morphemes during the process of grammaticization, one striking feature of this process is a dramatic frequency increase. This increase comes about as a result of an increase in the number and types of contexts in which the gram is appropriate. Frequency is not just a result of grammaticization, it is also a primary contributor to the process, an active force in instigating the changes that occur in grammaticization. This chapter treats two topics: (i) the manner in which the extreme frequency increase occurs, which will be examined via a case study of can in Old and Middle English; and (ii) those mechanisms of change associated with grammaticization that are attributable in some way to this dramatic frequency increase, including phonological, morphosyntactic, and semantic change. A third important theme of this chapter echoes that found in Traugott (this volume): none of these changes can be studied except in the context of the construction in which the grammaticizing element occurs.},

The essential idea underlying this generalization is to examine the impact on the precision of estimation—in particular, the size of an ellipsoidal joint confidence region for β 1—of less-than-optimal selection of other columns of the design matrix (X 2), treating still other columns (X 0) as unalterable, even hypothetically. In typical applications, X 1 contains a set of dummy regressors coding categories of a qualitative variable or a set of polynomial regressors in a quantitative variable; X 2 contains all other regressors in the model, save the constant, which is in X 0. If σ 2 V denotes the realized variance of , and σ 2 U is the variance associated with an optimal selection of X 2, then the corresponding scaled dispersion ellipsoids to be compared are ℰ v = x : x′V –1 x ≤ 1 and ℰ U = x : x′U –1 x ≤ 1, where ℰ U is contained in ℰ v . The two ellipsoids can be compared by considering the radii of ℰ v relative to ℰ U , obtained through the spectral decomposition of V relative to U. We proceed to explore the geometry of generalized variance inflation, to show the relationship of these measures to correlation-matrix determinants and canonical correlations, to consider X matrices structured by relations of marginality among regressor subspaces, to develop the relationship of generalized variance inflation to hypothesis tests in the multivariate normal linear model, and to present several examples.},

	abstract = {Questo lavoro si propone di ricostruire un ipotetico tracciato di diffusione della cultura iberica in Italia, principiato a partire dal prestigioso catalizzatore della corte aragonese di Napoli, e via via ramificatosi attraverso i centri dell'Italia padana a cavallo tra Quattro e Cinquecento. Visti i primi contatti a opera di mercenari, studenti ed ecclesiastici, si passa a studiare la fioritura della cultura plurilingue raccolta attorno ad Alfonso di Trastámara nel quadro della rete di relazioni, soprattutto matrimoniali, intessute con le corti settentrionali. Sulla scorta dei vari accasamenti, a cui si somma quello splendido di Lucrezia Borgia con Alfonso d'Este, si spargono attraverso la penisola intrattenitori e artisti di diversa qualità, interpreti di una letteratura, talvolta estemporanea, che finisce per interessare pure intellettuali di peso, come il Bembo e l'Equicola, arbitri di una cultura cortigiana che, ai suoi margini, si apre alle novità originate nella Penisola iberica. Al termine di questo excursus, interrotto con l'incoronazione bolognese di Carlo V, si raccolgono i segnali di un'assimilazione ormai compiuta, e, come si suggerisce nell'ultima sezione, sfociata nei primi accenni di un'operazione critica e di sistemazione, parallela al recupero delle lettere provenzali, che provvederà le condizioni per i primi passi della romanistica cinquecentesca. The present work aims to reconstruct a hypothetical blueprint of the spread of Iberian culture in Italy, which gradually extended to the centers of Northern Italy between the 15th and the 16th centuries, since the settling of the Aragonese court in Naples. Starting from the first contacts thanks to mercenaries, ecclesiastics and university students, the essay continues analysing the flowering of the multilingual culture gathered around Alfonso of Trastámara, related to the northern courts through nuptial agreements. As a result of various marriages, included the matrimony between Lucrezia Borgia and Alfonso d'Este, several Spaniard poets and entertainers left the South directed to the Po valley, where they diffused models of literature –sometimes extemporaneous– that eventually interested important intellectuals such as Pietro Bembo and Mario Equicola, arbiters of a courtesan culture slightly opening to Iberian literatures. The conclusion of the present article outlines the first attempts of interpretation of this production and the effort to compare romance languages and culture during the Renaissance, in parallel with the redicosvery of Occitan literature, as the definitive proof of complete assimilation and consequent criticism.},

	abstract = {This article examines crosslinguistic variation in FILLER-GAP DEPENDENCIES (WH-questions and relative clauses) from a processing perspective, and integrates research findings from psycholinguistics, language typology and generative grammar. Numerous implicational universals and hierarchies are proposed that receive a natural explanation in terms of processing and complexity. Filler-gap domains are complex in proportion to their size and in proportion to the amount of simultaneous syntactic and semantic processing that is required in addition to gap identification. They are simplified by making the gap easier to identify and process, or by avoiding a gap structure altogether. When grammatical variation is viewed from this perspective many descriptive insights and implicational patterns can be motivated that have either been stipulated or that have gone unnoticed hitherto. This approach provides an alternative to the assumption of innate parameterized subjacency constraints in this area.},

This argues the need for a better balance in the literature and in statistical teaching between techniques and problem solving strategies." Whether analyzing risk factors, adjusting for biases in observational studies, or developing predictive models, there are common problems that few regression texts address. For example, there are missing data in the majority of datasets one is likely to encounter (other than those used in textbooks!) but most regression texts do not include methods for dealing with such data effectively, and texts on missing data do not cover regression modeling.},

I consider and reject the influential proposal from Thompson \& Mulac (1991b) that the occurrence of zero complementizer in these contexts is associated with syntactic reanalysis of the epistemic verb and its subject to an adverbial-like epistemic phrase. Instead, I propose that zero complementizer signals a shift in the informational structure of the utterance, in which the embedded clause conveys the main assertion, but the syntactic structure of the sentence need not be altered. Further routinization is evident with I think but not with other epistemic verbs. Results from a study of newspaper prose are presented in support of the analysis.},

	abstract = {A classic book about language acquisition and conceptual structure, with a new preface by the author, "The Secret Life of Verbs."Before Steven Pinker wrote bestsellers on language and human nature, he wrote several technical monographs on language acquisition that have become classics in cognitive science. Learnability and Cognition, first published in 1989, brought together two big topics: how do children learn their mother tongue, and how does the mind represent basic categories of meaning such as space, time, causality, agency, and goals? The stage for this synthesis was set by the fact that when children learn a language, they come to make surprisingly subtle distinctions: pour water into the glass and fill the glass with water sound natural, but pour the glass with water and fill water into the glass sound odd. How can this happen, given that children are not reliably corrected for uttering odd sentences, and they don't just parrot back the correct ones they hear from their parents? Pinker resolves this paradox with a theory of how children acquire the meaning and uses of verbs, and explores that theory's implications for language, thought, and the relationship between them.As Pinker writes in a new preface, "The Secret Life of Verbs," the phenomena and ideas he explored in this book inspired his 2007 bestseller The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window into Human Nature. These technical discussions, he notes, provide insight not just into language acquisition but into literary metaphor, scientific understanding, political discourse, and even the conceptions of sexuality that go into obscenity.},

	abstract = {The present article contrasts two processing principles, the Domain Minimization Principle (e.g. Hawkins 1999, 2004) and the Complexity Principle (e.g. Rohdenburg 1996, 2007b) in structures involving the extraction of postverbal elements out of (competing) complement clauses. The Domain Minimization Principle may be described as a processing tendency which consists in minimizing the size and complexity of various domains including the filler–gap domain in cases like the following: This is a problem (that) they had promised (that) they would tackle. By contrast, the Complexity Principle represents a correlation between processing complexity and grammatical explicitness. It stipulates that more explicit (and typically more bulky) constructional options are favoured in cognitively more complex environments.This article deals with two sets of rival complements. The behaviour of the first group of clausal alternatives is in line with Hawkins’ prediction, though incompatible with the Complexity Principle. However, there is an even larger group of complement pairs whose distribution inside and outside extraction contexts is predicted by the Complexity Principle but unaccounted for by Domain Minimization. Thus, in extraction contexts, the visible effects of the two antagonistic principles are found with virtually complementary ranges of complement types. The article concludes by attempting to account for the kind of division of labour observed between the two principles under scrutiny. It will be suggested among other things that, in English, the marked infinitive (on its own or with an associated NP) enjoys a privileged or target status in extraction contexts.},

Previous studies of this phenomenon have used the variable rule program, a generalized linear model; however, recent developments in statistics have introduced new tools, including mixed-effects models, random forests, and conditional inference trees that may open additional possibilities for data exploration, analysis, and interpretation. In a step-by-step demonstration, we show how this well-known variable benefits from these complementary techniques. Mixed-effects models provide a principled way of assessing the importance of random-effect factors such as the individuals in the sample. Random forests provide information about the importance of predictors, whether factorial or continuous, and do so also for unbalanced designs with high multicollinearity, cases for which the family of linear models is less appropriate. Conditional inference trees straightforwardly visualize how multiple predictors operate in tandem. Taken together, the results confirm that polarity, distance from verb to plural element, and the nature of the DP are significant predictors. Ongoing linguistic change and social reallocation via morphologization are operational. Furthermore, the results make predictions that can be tested in future research. We conclude that variationist research can be substantially enriched by an expanded tool kit.},

It is to answer the question: How many kinds of illocutionary acts are there?Since any such attempt to develop a taxonomy must take into account Austin's classification of illocutionary acts into his five basic categories of verdictive, expositive, exercitive, behabitive, and commissive, a second purpose of this paper is to assess Austin's classification to show in what respects it is adequate and in what respects inadequate. Furthermore, since basic semantic differences are likely to have syntactical consequences, a third purpose of this paper is to show how these different basic illocutionary types are realized in the syntax of a natural language such as English.In what follows, I shall presuppose a familiarity with the general pattern of analysis of illocutionary acts offered in such works as How to Do Things with Words (Austin, 1962), Speech Acts (Searle, 1969), and ‘Austin on Locutionary and Illocutionary Acts’ (Searle, 1968). In particular, I shall presuppose a distinction between the illocutionary force of an utterance and its propositional content as symbolizedF(p)The aim of this paper then is to classify the different types of F.DIFFERENT TYPES OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF ILLOCUTIONARY ACTSAny taxonomical effort of this sort presupposes criteria for distinguishing one (kind of) illocutionary act from another.},

These associations are shaped by domain-general learning processes that are operative in language use and sensitive to frequency of occurrence.

The authors describe and account for some remarkable parallelisms in the linguistic construction of utterances with which people express themselves in different languages and cultures. A motive for these parallels is isolated and a universal model is constructed outlining the abstract principles underlying polite usages.

The visualization of data plays a key role, both in the initial stages of data exploration and later on when the reader is encouraged to criticize various models. Containing over 40 exercises with model answers, this book will be welcomed by all linguists wishing to learn more about working with and presenting quantitative data.},

	abstract = {The present contribution examines object complement clauses from the perspective of constituent-order typology. In particular, it provides the first principled empirical investigation of the position of object clauses relative to the matrix verb. Based on a stratified sample of 100 languages, we establish that there is an overall cross-linguistic preference for postverbal complements, due largely to the heterogeneous ordering patterns in OV-languages. Importantly, however, we also show that the position of complement clauses correlates with aspects of their structural organization: Preverbal complement clauses are significantly more likely to be coded by morphosyntactically “downgraded” structures than postverbal complements. Given that previous research has found a parallel correlation between structural downgrading and the semantics of the complement-taking predicate (Givón 1980. The binding hierarchy and the typology of complements. Studies in Language 4. 333–377, Cristofaro 2003. Subordination . Oxford: Oxford University Press), one needs to analyze how positional, structural and semantic factors interact with one another. Our data suggest that the correlation between clause order and morphosyntactic structure holds independently of semantic considerations: All predicate classes distinguished in the present study increase their likelihood of taking downgraded complements if they are preceded by the complement clause. We thus propose that, in addition to the well-known “binding hierarchy”, a second correlation needs to be recognized in the typology of complementation: the co-variation of linear order and morphosyntactic structure.},

It presents a synthesis that draws together and refines the descriptive and theoretical notions developed in this framework over the course of three decades. In a unified manner, it accommodates both the conceptual and the social-interactive basis of linguistic structure, as well as the need for both functional explanation and explicit structural description. Starting with the fundamentals, essential aspects of the theory are systematically laid out with concrete illustrations and careful discussion of their rationale. Among the topics surveyed are conceptual semantics, grammatical classes, grammatical constructions, the lexicon-grammar continuum characterized as assemblies of symbolic structures (form-meaning pairings), and the usage-based account of productivity, restrictions, and well-formedness. The theory's central claim - that grammar is inherently meaningful - is thereby shown to be viable. The framework is further elucidated through application to nominal structure, clause structure, and complex sentences. These are examined in broad perspective, with exemplification from English and numerous other languages. In line with the theory's general principles, they are discussed not only in terms of their structural characterization, but also their conceptual value and functional motivation. Other matters explored include discourse, the temporal dimension of language structure, and what grammar reveals about cognitive processes and the construction of our mental world.},

	url = {DOI: 10.1515/9783110199215},
	abstract = {This book analyzes the form and function of the English passive from a verb-based point of view. It takes the position that the various surface forms of the passive (with or without thematic subject, with or without object, with or without by -phrase, with or without auxiliary) have a common source and are determined by the interplay of the syntactic properties of the verb and general syntactic principles. Each structural element of the passive construction is examined separately, and the participle is considered the only defining component of the passive. Special emphasis is put on the existence of an implicit argument (ususally an agent) and its representation in the passive. A review of data from syntax, language acquisition, and psycholinguistics shows that the implicit agent is not just a conceptually understood argument. It is argued that it is represented at the level of argument structure and that this is what sets the passive apart from other patient-subject constructions. A corpus-based case study on the use of the passive in academic writing analyzes the use of the passive in this particular register. One of the findings is that about 20-25\% of passives occur in constructions that do not require an auxiliary, a result that challenges corpus studies on the use of the passive that only consider full be -passives. It is also shown that new active-voice constructions have emerged that compete with the passive without having a more visible agent. The emergence of these constructions (such as "This paper argues...") is discussed in the context of changes in the rhetoric of scientific discourse. The book is mainly of interest to linguists and graduate students in the areas of English syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.},

	abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that probabilistic grammars may be modulated by communication mode and genre. Accordingly, the question arises how complex language users’ lectal competence is, where complexity is proportional to the extent to which choice-making processes depend on the situation of language use. Do probabilistic constraints vary when we talk to a friend compared to when we give a speech? Are differences between spoken and written language larger than those within each mode? In the present study, we aim to approach these questions systematically. Guided by theorizing in cognitive (socio)linguistics and using logistic regression based on corpus materials, we analyzed the dative alternation with give ( The government gives farmers money vs. The government gives money to farmers ) in four broad registers of English: spoken informal, spoken formal, written informal, and written formal. Corpus analysis was supplemented with a scalar rating experiment. Results suggest that language users’ probabilistic grammars vary as a function of register.},

This study aims to explain how and why this change (or set of changes) took place when and where it did by using the model of koineization as a heuristic device. It argues that sociocultural factors (particularly widespread social status anxiety) and the salience of address forms played a primary role in driving the changes forward. It also argues, however, that sociodemographic factors associated with koineization (demographic movement and dialect mixing) contributed significantly to the timing, rapidity, location, and specific outcomes, including the grammaticalization of vuestra merced to usted and numerous other reduced forms.},

	abstract = {This book is an introduction to statistics for linguists using the open source software R. It is aimed at students and instructors/professors with little or no statistical background and is written in a non-technical and reader-friendly/accessible style. It first introduces in detail the overall logic underlying quantitative studies: exploration, hypothesis formulation and operationalization, and the notion and meaning of significance tests. It then introduces some basics of the software R relevant to statistical data analysis. A chapter on descriptive statistics explains how summary statistics for frequencies, averages, and correlations are generated with R and how they are graphically represented best. A chapter on analytical statistics explains how statistical tests are performed in R on the basis of many different linguistic case studies: For nearly every single example, it is explained what the structure of the test looks like, how hypotheses are formulated, explored, and tested for statistical significance, how the results are graphically represented, and how one would summarize them in a paper/article. A chapter on selected multifactorial methods introduces how more complex research designs can be studied: methods for the study of multifactorial frequency data, correlations, tests for means, and binary response data are discussed and exemplified step-by-step. Also, the exploratory approach of hierarchical cluster analysis is illustrated in detail. The book comes with many exercises, boxes with short think breaks and warnings, recommendations for further study, and answer keys as well as a statistics for linguists newsgroup on the companion website. The volume is aimed at beginners on every level of linguistic education: undergraduate students, graduate students, and instructors/professors and can be used in any research methods and statistics class for linguists. It presupposes no quantitative/statistical knowledge whatsoever and, unlike most competing books, begins at step 1 for every method and explains everything explicitly.},

We provide an overview of Romance languages and propose functional and formal definitions of complementation, complementizers and ‘canonical’ complementizers, focusing on the Romance complementizers corresponding to the English if and that. We describe the syntactic behavior of these complementizers, then focus on their semantic aspects and distribution; we show that a general function of illocutionary subordination is common to all complementizers, as is proven by the semantic effects of complementizer omission. The semantic analysis of these complementizers enables us to specify which kind of non-factuality is encoded in complements introduced by ‘if’ complementizers. We go on to examine the diachronic sources of Romance complementizers and we finally focus on the marginal deviations found in Romanian on the one hand and French on the other hand as compared to other Romance languages.},

This book presents an in-depth study of the language of letters focussing on a unique collection of Dutch private letters from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which comprises letters from the lower, middle and upper ranks, written by men as well as women.The book discusses the key issues of formulaic language and the degree of orality of private letters, it questions the importance of letter-writing manuals, and reveals remarkable patterns of social, regional and gender variation in a wide range of linguistic features. Arguing for writing experience as an important factor in historical linguistics generally, the book offers numerous new perspectives on the history of Dutch.The monograph is of interest to a wide readership, ranging from scholars of historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, Germanic linguistics, sociology and social history to (advanced) graduate and postgraduate students in courses on language variation and change.},

	shorttitle = {English {Grammar}},
	abstract = {The approach to language and grammar that motivates this book is unabashedly functional; grammar is not just a system of empty rules, it is a means to an end, an instrument for constructing concise coherent communication. In grammar as in music, good expression rides on good form. Figuratively and literally, grammar like musical form must make sense. But for the instrument to serve its purpose, it must first exist; the rules must be real, they can be explicitly described and taught. This book is intended for both students and teachers, at college level, for both native and nonnative speakers. With the guidance of a teacher this book will serve as a thorough introduction to the grammar of English. Volume I begins with words and their meanings, then on to propositions and simple state or event clauses  participant roles, verb types, transitivity, subjects and objects. It then covers the grammatical sub systems commonly found in simple clauses: Verbal inflections, auxiliaries and the grammar of tense-aspect modality and negation; articles determiners, pronouns and the grammar of referential coherence; the variety of noun phrases and noun modifiers.},

	abstract = {In the functional-linguistic literature, amenazar and other ‘threaten’ verbs have been accounted for in terms of grammaticalization and subjectification of the lexical construction/reading of amenazar + infinitive into a subjective construction/reading of amenazar + infinitive. On the basis of diachronic corpus data we show that this view does not hold: the syntactic schema of subjective amenazar + infinitive starts from a construction of the Latin verb minari ‘threaten’ with a deverbal noun. The origin of the subjective construction with amenazar and the pace of the extension of the new construction depend heavily on the contact with humanist, Latin-based discourse traditions. The proposed analysis suggests the need of revisiting earlier accounts of ‘threaten’ verbs that were based on conceptual and pragmatic criteria only.},

This book addresses the two issues that are basic to this claim: first, the question of what types of elements are frequently used in discourse and second, the question of how frequency of use affects cognitive representations. Reporting on evidence from natural conversation, diachronic change, variability, child language acquisition and psycholinguistic experimentation the original articles in this book support two major principles. First, the content of people s interactions consists of a preponderance of subjective, evaluative statements, dominated by the use of pronouns, copulas and intransitive clauses. Second, the frequency with which certain items and strings of items are used has a profound influence on the way language is broken up into chunks in memory storage, the way such chunks are related to other stored material and the ease with which they are accessed to produce new utterances.},

	abstract = {IntroductionIn previous works I have focused attention on the role of repetition or frequency in the creation of linguistic structure through language change (see Bybee 2007). All the frequency effects I have identified work in conjunction with particular processing mechanisms. In this chapter and the next two, I examine the processing mechanisms whose repeated application gives shape to grammar, in an attempt to uncover the properties of these mechanisms. The goal, to the extent possible, is to identify the domain-general mechanisms that underlie language. These mechanisms, in conjunction with an exemplar model of linguistic representation and organization, can readily represent the ongoing modifications of the linguistic system that explain its patterning, as well as its synchronic variation and change over time.By ‘processing’ I refer to the activities involved in both production of the message and the decoding of it. Thus the discussion includes in principle the set of cognitive and neuromotor mechanisms or activities that are put into use in online communication and in the mental storage of language. My hypothesis is that the particular way these processing mechanisms work determines fairly directly the facts about the nature of language. In particular, we will be examining the nature of chunking and the consequent phonetic reduction of repeated sequences, as well as the maintenance and loss of analysability and compositionality in complex expressions due to the effects of repetition.},

They are, therefore, private letters that reflect characteristics of communicative closeness. In this way, these texts bring us as close as possible to the language of the most intimate oral exchanges. This study will make it possible to advance in the knowledge of the characteristics of Spanish in general and of the Spanish spoken in Catalan-speaking lands at a time when Spanish in Barcelona was already emerging as a distinct variety.},

	url = {http://uri.gbv.de/document/gvk:ppn:821593390},
	abstract = {The dissertation provides a cross-linguistic investigation into the grammatical structure of complement clauses and the organization of complementation systems. Based on a balanced sample of 100 widely dispersed languages, the major goals of the present work are to set the two landmark typological reference articles on complementation (Noonan 1985{\textbar}2007, Dixon 2006) onto a broad empirical basis and to explore hitherto understudied phenomena in the constitution of complementation systems. In particular, the traditional focus on object complement clauses is shifted to complements in `subject' function, and the dissertation is the first to analyse systematically the cross-linguistic productivity, morphosyntactic coding, syntagmatic arrangement and diachronic rise of complements in S- and A-function, as compared to their corresponding object clauses. On a methodological plane, it combines a multivariate approach to clause-linkage with recent statistical techniques of data mining (e.g. HCFA, cluster analyses, NeighborNet, MDS) in order to measure (dis)similarities in the cross-linguistic organization of complementation constructions. This comprises, for example, a precise gauging of the degree to which the internal structure of complements is `desententialized' (Lehmann 1988) and made NP-like, of the ways in which this correlates with the possible external functions and positions of the complement in the main clause, and of the ways in which these distributional patterns in complementation systems reflect the historical origins and lexical diffusion of the relevant constructions. Above all, the dissertation problematizes the conceptual and terminological foundations for the typological study of complementation, which, despite decades of intensive research, remain challenging to establish in a cross-linguistically satisfactory way.},

	abstract = {This book addresses a question fundamental to any discussion of grammatical theory and grammatical variation: to what extent can principles of grammar be explained through language use? The book argues that there is a profound correspondence between performance data and the fixed conventions of grammars. Preferences and patterns found in the one, the book shows, are reflected in constraints and variation patterns in the other. The theoretical consequences of the proposed ‘performance-grammar correspondence hypothesis’ are far-reaching — for current grammatical formalisms, for the innateness hypothesis, and for psycholinguistic models of performance and learning. Drawing on empirical generalizations and insights from language typology, generative grammar, psycholinguistics, and historical linguistics, this book demonstrates that the assumption that grammars are immune to performance is false. It presents detailed empirical case studies and arguments for an alternative theory in which performance has shaped the conventions of grammars and thus the variation patterns found in the world’s languages. The innateness of language, the book argues, resides primarily in the mechanisms human beings have for processing and learning it.},

In all experiments, speakers did not consistently include optional words to circumvent a temporary ambiguity, but they did omit optional words (the complementizer that) when subsequent material was either repeated (within a sentence) or prompted with a recall cue.

              The likelihood with which language users insert optional words or morphemes that explicitly mark syntactic structure tends to increase in complex grammatical environments. This positive correlation between explicitness and complexity, best known as the Complexity Principle, has been observed for a multitude of case studies in both naturally occurring language and experimental settings. Researchers have sought the explanation for this Complexity Principle in three different domains: cognitive comprehension processing, the language channel, and cognitive production processing. Based on these accounts, we formulate predictions regarding the action radius of the Complexity Principle in the alternation between a direct and prepositional object of the Dutch verb
              zoeken
              ‘search’. These predictions are tested against corpus observations. Our results confirm accounts according to which optional elements indicate production difficulties, as well as those that explain the Principle as a result of restrictions on the language channel. In addition, our results indicate that the Principle is sensitive to context-determined restrictions that are the result of its underlying cause. This may present a possible caveat for alternation studies.},

To substantiate this claim, we analyze the alternation between the Spanish past subjunctive forms ending in –ra and –se (as in comiera and comiese ‘had eaten’). Due to the ongoing replacement of –se by –ra , persistence and frequency are the best predictors of the alternation in our data. First, the persistence effect of a prior –se is significantly greater than the persistence effect of a prior –ra . Second, although –se is basically restricted to third person singular morphology in contexts without persistence, when primed by –se this restriction is drastically reduced. Our results also shed light on the relationship between frequency and persistence in language change. Although both result in conservation, the conserving effect of frequency causes irregularity such as the paradigmatic atrophy of Spanish –se forms. In contrast, persistence can temporarily re-establish paradigmatic regularity and consequently strengthen the cognitive representation of obsolescing constructions. However, this resuscitating effect of persistence appears to be restricted to low-frequency –se forms; because they are generally more entrenched, the activation of high-frequency –se forms relies less on persistence effects.},

              que
              ‘that’). While many authors regard this construction as a stylistic variant which eventually
					declined (i.a.,
              Girón 2005
              ), so far no exhaustive morphosyntactic study of the
					phenomenon has been presented, as previous works either have focused on only one predicate (

              ,
              2018

					quantitative data (
              Pountain 2015
              ). Using evidence from richly annotated corpus data
					spanning between 1400 and 1799 (
              GITHE 2015
              ), we adopt the diachronic probabilistic
					grammar framework (
              Szmrecsanyi 2013
              ) by means of multifactorial statistical models, to
					identify the language-internal probabilistic constraints that regulated the
              que
              /Ø alternation, and to explore
					whether their relevance changed diachronically. The results indicate that asyndetic complementation is promoted in the domain of
					manipulation verbs (e.g., requests and commands) and, more generally, by the semantic and syntactic integration of events (
              Givón
					2001a
              ). Diachronically we observe that some of the effects strengthened over time, suggesting a syntactic specialization process,
					which might have eventually led to the restricted and marked use of the asyndeton in Modern Spanish.},

Theoretically, we transfer the notion of ‘probabilistic grammar’ to historical data and claim that the corpus models presented reflect past speakers’ knowledge about the distribution of genitive and dative variants. The historical data also helps to determine what is constant (and timeless) in the effect of selected factors such as animacy or length, and what is variant.},

              The paper surveys overlap between corpus linguistics and variationist sociolinguistics. Corpus linguistics is customarily defined as a methodology that bases claims about language on usage patterns in collections of naturalistic, authentic speech or text. Because this is what is typically done in variationist sociolinguistics work, I argue that variationist sociolinguists are by definition corpus linguists, though of course the reverse is not true: the variationist method entails more than merely analyzing usage data, and not all corpus analysts are interested in variation. But that being said, a considerable and arguably increasing number of corpus linguists not formally trained in variationist sociolinguistics are explicitly concerned with variation and engage in what I call
              corpus-based variationist linguistics
              (CVL). I first discuss what unites or divides work in CVL and in variationist sociolinguistics. In a plea to cross subdisciplinary boundaries, I subsequently identify three research areas where variationist sociolinguists may draw inspiration from work in CVL: conducting multi-variable research, paying more attention to probabilistic grammars, and taking more seriously the register-sensitivity of variation patterns.

            Résumé
            
              Cet article explore le chevauchement entre la linguistique de corpus et la sociolinguistique variationniste. La linguistique de corpus est typiquement définie comme une méthodologie qui fonde ses affirmations linguistiques sur les régularités de l'usage émergeant des collectes de données orales ou textuelles naturalistes et authentiques. Puisque c'est ce qui se fait généralement en sociolinguistique variationniste, je soutiens que les sociolinguistes variationnistes sont par définition des linguistes de corpus, bien que l'inverse ne soit pas vrai: la méthode variationniste implique davantage que le seul fait d'analyser les données de l'usage, et tous les analystes de corpus ne s'intéressent pas à la variation. Ceci étant dit, un nombre grandissant de linguistes de corpus n'ayant pas été formellement formés en sociolinguistique variationniste s'intéressent explicitement à la variation et s'investissent dans ce que j'appelle la
              linguistique variationniste basée sur les corpus
              (en anglais,
              corpus-based variationist linguistics
              ou CVL). Je discute d'abord ce qui unit et ce qui divise la linguistique variationniste basée sur les corpus et la sociolinguistique variationniste. Dans un appel visant à franchir les frontières des sous-disciplines, j'identifie ensuite trois domaines de recherche où les sociolinguistes variationnistes peuvent s'inspirer des travaux en linguistique variationniste basée sur les corpus: effectuer des recherches multi-variables, accorder plus d'attention aux grammaires probabilistes et prendre plus au sérieux la sensibilité au registre des modèles de variation.},

It illustrates register variation analysis in different theoretical frameworks, such as Probabilistic Grammar, Systemic Functional Linguistics, and Information Theory, and proposes a new framework within the Text Linguistic Approach: the continuous-situational analytical framework. Several of the contributions apply Multi-Dimensional Analysis to corpus data in order to unveil register (dis)similarities, while others rely on logistic regression models and periodization techniques based on Kullback-Leibler divergence. The volume includes both inter-register and intra-register variation analysis of a wide spectrum of varieties, speakers and periods: British and American English, learner varieties, L2 varieties, and also contains diachronic studies covering early and late Modern English. This broad scope should be a source of inspiration for anyone interested in historical and ongoing register variation in a vast range of varieties of English worldwide.},

This tendency has been cited in support of the claim that probabilities are an inherent part of grammar, and of syntax in particular. There is widespread consensus, however, that the syntax of natural languages cannot be captured in terms of item-to-item transitions (Chomsky 1957). Therefore, unless one considers probabilities of syntactic structures, rather than particular combinations of neighboring words, pronunciation variation cannot be said to reflect probabilistic effects in syntax. In this article, we report a case of pronunciation variation that reflects contextual probabilities of syntactic structures. The relevant probabilities are based on the probability of a given syntactic structure, given a particular verb. We showthat these probabilities affect American English /t,d/- deletion, as well as the durations of words and phrases. Our results are consistent with the notion that knowledge of grammar includes knowledge of probabilities of syntactic structures, and that this knowledge affects language production.},

	title = {Predicting the dative alternation},
	abstract = {Theoretical linguists have traditionally relied on linguistic intuitions such as gram- maticality judgments for their data. But the massive growth of computer-readable texts and recordings, the availability of cheaper, more powerful computers and soft- ware, and the development of new probabilistic models for language have now made the spontaneous use of language in natural settings a rich and easily accessible alter- native source of data.
Surprisingly, many linguists believe that such ‘usage data’ are irrelevant to the theory of grammar. Four problems are repeatedly brought up in the critiques of usage data—
1. correlated factors seeming to support reductive theories,
2. pooled data invalidating grammatical inference,
3. syntactic choices reducing to lexical biases, and
4. cross-corpus differences undermining corpus studies.
Presenting a case study of work on the English dative alternation, we show first, that linguistic intuitions of grammaticality are deeply flawed and seriously underes- timate the space of grammatical possibility, and second, that the four problems in the critique of usage data are empirical issues that can be resolved by using modern statistical theory and modelling strategies widely used in other fields.
The new models allow linguistic theory to solve more difficult problems than it has in the past, and to build convergent projects with psychology, computer science, and allied fields of cognitive science.},

First, using data from the York-Toronto-Helsinki Corpus of Old English Prose (YCOE) and the Penn corpora, a classification is proposed of the verbs occurring in the SPC. Based on this semantic classification, the development of the SPC is then traced from Old English to Late Modern English in terms of frequency and productivity. It is argued that, while the various classes of SPC-taking verbs often show opposite developments, these lower-level incongruities are resolved at a higher schematic level, as the SPC as a whole underwent a process of internalization. These findings underscore the importance of lower-level developments in the diachronic behavior of schematic constructions and consequently contribute to the literature on constructional change.},

	abstract = {This article explores the importance of register variation for analyses of grammar and discourse. The general theme is illustrated through consideration of variability in the form and use of English complement clauses. First, the patterns of use for four related grammatical constructions are considered: that-clauses and to-clauses, headed by verbs and by nouns. The differing discourse functions of each construction type are explored by considering their lexico-grammatical associations (i.e. the verbs or nouns most commonly occurring as the head of each type). However, it is shown that the characteristic uses of each type are conditioned by register. That is, each construction type has a different distribution across spoken and written registers, with a different set of associated lexical heads. A second study provides an even more striking illustration of this interaction between grammar, discourse, and register: the contextual factors conditioning the retention vs omission of the complementizer that. In this case, it is shown that each register has an overall norm, and that contextual factors are influential only when they work in opposition to that register norm. These case studies are presented to make the general point that analyses of grammar and discourse are often inadequate and misleading when they disregard register differences. Instead, a register perspective is required to capture the range of variability associated with grammatical patterns of use.},

              The present paper traces the history of
              zero
              and
              that
              as competing links for object clauses in the history of English from chronological and sociolinguistic perspectives. Even though the zero link is sporadically attested in Old English, the rise of the zero complementizer takes place in late Middle English and is well-established in the second half of the sixteenth century, becoming more frequent in speech-based text types (trials, sermons) or in texts representing the oral mode of expression (fiction, comedies). The use of this construction is then observed to diminish drastically in the eighteenth century, plausibly as a result of the prescriptive bias of grammarians (Warner 1982; Fanego 1990; Rissanen 1991, Rissanen 1999; Finegan and Biber 1995). Our analysis is based on five high frequency verbs,
              to know
              ,
              to think
              ,
              to say
              ,
              to tell
              and
              to hope
              , and their syntactic behaviour in the
              Parsed Corpus of Early English Correspondence
              , especially in the periods 1424–1499, 1500–1569, 1570–1639 and 1640–1681. Our approach aims at showing progress of the zero link along the S curve in these four periods, before it became thwarted in the eighteenth century. We also aim at plotting the diffusion of zero
              that
              -clauses against the social hierarchy of the period in order to detect (i) the existence of social stratification for this variant, and, if such be the case, (ii) the social group or groups that were leading the diffusion of the change in the different chronological stages, thus (iii) tracing the social origin and direction of the change as diffusing
              from below
              or
              from above

We will posit that the oppositions described are the effect of the presence versus absence of V raising to the CP field in EP versus BP. Going back to work by Den Besten (1977) and following Ambar (2005, 2007), we will assume that the understanding of this phenomenon is to be seen in properties of Tense, conspiring for the following working hypothesis: BP has no V-to-C because V doesn\&amp;\#8217;t move out of vP, EP has V-to-C because V can move out of vP.},

One of the properties of such systems is that they rely on what in biology is called ‘degeneracy’, a technical term for the phenomenon that structurally different elements can fulfill the same function. In this article, it is suggested that degenerate strategies help languages sustain instability in times of syntactic changes. Taking a Construction Grammar approach, it is shown that so-called horizontal relations in constructional networks -- in which related constructions in a functional domain are mutually defined by differential values they take on a set of grammatical parameters -- can be transmitted through time, even if the specific grammatical parameters on which they are defined are under threat. Evidence is drawn from two different domains: argument realisation in experience processes and adverbial subordination.},

By applying several subsequent quantitative analyses on corpus instances of the sequences N de que and N que, the locus of variation is restricted to such an extent that the variation can largely be accounted for. A collostructional analysis identifies 31 central nouns of the N de que complement clause construction. A diachronic cluster analysis delimits the temporal dimension of the variation to the 16th and 17th centuries. A distinctive collexeme analysis identifies nine nouns which are used in both constructional formats to a comparable degree: causa ‘cause’, duda ‘doubt’, esperanza ‘hope’, fe ‘faith’, opinión ‘opinion’, recelo ‘fear’, señal ‘sign(al)’, sospecha ‘suspicion’, and temor ‘fear’. Detailed contextual analysis of the use of these nine nouns by means of a mixed-effects logistic regression reveals that the use of the nouns with a determiner is correlated with the de que variant, and the use of the nouns as part of complex predicates, as in tener sospecha ‘have suspicion’, is associated with the que variant of the complement clause.},

	abstract = {This paper uses diachronic corpus data to visualize language change in a dynamic fashion. Bivariate and multivariate data sets form the input for so-called motion charts, i.e. series of diachronically ordered scatterplots that can be viewed in sequence. Based on data from COHA (Davies 2010), two case studies illustrate recent changes in American English. The first study visualizes change in a diachronic analysis of ambicategorical nouns and verbs such as
              hope
              or
              drink
              ; the second study shows structural change in the behavior of complement-taking predicates such as
              expect
              or
              remember
              . Whereas motion charts are typically used to represent bivariate data sets, it is argued here that they are also useful for the analysis of multivariate data over time. The present paper submits multivariate diachronic data to a multi-dimensional scaling analysis. Viewing the resulting data points in separate time slices offers a holistic and intuitive representation of complex linguistic change.},

              Many grammaticalization pathways recur across languages. A prominent explanation for this is that the properties of lexical items determine their developmental pathways. However, it is unclear why these pathways do not
              always
              occur. In this article, we ask why English did not undergo a cross-linguistically common grammaticalization pathway,

              {\textgreater}
               
              anterior
              . We operationalize this question by testing a theory proposed on results regarding a language that did undergo this change, Spanish, on corpus and experimental data. While English
              finish
              constructions are associated with
              some
              of the distributional properties of Early Spanish
              finish
              , speakers do not show evidence of conventionally associating
              finish
              constructions with a particular type of inference crucial for the grammaticalization of the Spanish anterior. We propose that the non-conventionality of this inference blocks the grammaticalization of
              finish
              constructions in English, demonstrating that some of the black box of language change currently attributed to chance can be explored empirically.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The relation between functionally similar forms is often described in terms of competition. This leads to the expectation that over time only one form can survive (substitution) or each form must find its unique niche in functional space (differentiation). However, competition cannot easily explain what causes functional overlap or how form-function mappings will be reorganized. It is argued here that the changes which competing forms undergo are steered by various analogical forces. As a result of analogy, competing forms often show attraction, becoming functionally more (instead of less) alike. Attraction can maintain and increase functional overlap in language. At the same time, competing forms are analogically anchored to a broader constructional network. Cases of differentiation typically follow from the relations in that network. Evidence is drawn from the literature and from three corpus-based case studies, addressing attraction and differentiation in English aspectual constructions, English secondary predicate constructions, and in a pair of Dutch degree modifiers. Evidence is provided of a phenomenon competition-based accounts could not predict (attraction), and a solution is offered for one they could not very well explain (differentiation). More generally it is shown that the development of competing forms must be understood against their broader grammatical context.},

	abstract = {With linguistics suffering from increasing fractionalization, it is necessary not to lose sight of the overall picture. It seems uncontroversial that the study of language consists of the following five components: processing, use, structure, variation, and change. While some of the relationships between these concepts have been investigated, a systematic integration of these components into a coherent framework is conspicuously missing. A modest attempt is made here to outline such a framework which makes the interrelationships of the components transparent. In all of these components, competition is found to play a key role. At its core, competition is a psycholinguistic effect which arises in the task of selecting an intended unit from among a number of elements concurrently activated in the processing network. The audible and visible outcome of the selection process is language use. Language structure is the prerequisite for competition in that it provides the set of competitors. When competition is low, consistent (i.e., invariant) language use emerges. When competition is high, language use is variable, i.e., synchronic variation occurs. When competition changes over time, language change takes place. Thus, it is language processing in general and competition in particular that constrains and binds together many phenomena of language use, structure, variation, and change.},

El problema teórico específico es cómo valorar formas que ofrecen conflicto entre teoría y lengua en uso a la hora de analizar una determinada construcción como una posible activación por contacto. La evidencia empírica para el análisis son las frases nominales introducidas por artículo indefinido + posesivo, un mi amigo, una su tacita, en dos cortes cronológicos, español medieval y español actual centroamericano hablado por bilingües de maya-español o monolingües de español en contacto intenso con bilingües. Se hace un análisis cuantitativo diacrónico de dos corpus y cualitativo-cuantitativo diacrónico de tres variables en esos corpus y se muestra que los datos cuantitativos invitan a una explicación por contacto, mientras que los cualitativos sugieren una evolución interna, como una gramaticalización progresiva de nuevos valores. El análisis pone en evidencia que para el estudio de contacto en sintaxis es necesario distinguir, siguiendo a Otheguy (1995), entre convergencia comunicativa y convergencia lingüística. En el mantenimiento y actual empleo centroamericano de los sintagmas un mi amigo, una su comadre debió producirse convergencia cultural y comunicativa, pero no es posible probar cabalmente que se haya dado convergencia lingüística.},

	abstract = {In Quechua-dominant Spanish interlanguage in the Andean region the gerund is frequently found instead of finite verb forms typical of monolingual Spanish. Using data collected among Quichua-Spanish bilinguals in northern Ecuador, this study challenges claims that direct transfer of the Quichua subordinator -s(h)pa — often called a “gerund” — is the immediate source of the Andean Spanish gerund. Quichua-dominant bilinguals produce Spanish gerunds mostly in subordinate clauses, reflecting the general pattern of Quechua. However, in a Quichua-to-Spanish translation task, -shpa was most frequently translated as a gerund by school children who had received Quichua language classes, and least frequently by traditional Quichua-dominant speakers. An examination of historical documents suggests that the gerund was used in Spanish foreigner talk directed at indigenous speakers. The ultimate source of the -s(h)pa = Spanish gerund equation is traced to 16th and 17th century Quechua grammars written in the Latinate tradition, and to Spanish priests’ and missionaries’ (mis)appropriation of this grammatical interpretation in their interaction with indigenous speakers in the Andean zone.},

Readers are provided with the tools to discover how lexical and grammatical meanings can be related to one another in a principled way, how such issues as polysemy, heterosemy, and transcategoriality are dealt with, and why certain linguistic forms have simultaneous lexical and grammatical functions. Definitions of lexical concepts are provided with examples from a broad variety of languages, and references to key relevant research literature.

	abstract = {1. La lingüística histórica del español está en pleno florecimiento en los últimos años, y entre los factores que pueden servir para explicar este fenómeno se pueden nombrar, por un lado, el “boom” general de los estudios hispánicos, y, por otro lado, la riqueza de estudios generados por la introducción de una serie de paradigmas teóricos nuevos. El primero y sin duda más destacado es el que procura relacionar los cambios ocurridos a lo largo de la historia de la lengua con principios generales, observables en numerosas lenguas del mundo y asociables con determinados esquemas del pensamiento humano, esquemas cognitivos que hacen que se repitan ciertas evoluciones comparables a raíz de la universalidad de los principios del pensar y sin necesidad de parentesco genético entre las lenguas. Es obvio, si en las contribuciones a este número de la revista se plantea la cuestión general de la relación entre la historia externa y la evolución interna de la lengua, que los estudios de gramaticalización o de cambio léxico “cognitivo” no necesitan, en primera instancia, factores externos ya que ofrecen una visión puramente interna sobre las evoluciones lingüísticas, dependientes, eso sí, de los factores pragmáticos de la comunicación como lugar en el que los principios cognitivos se convierten en hechos de habla con posibilidad de volverse hechos de lengua, pero independientes, en un principio, de la visión “externa”. Aún así, la visión externa es necesaria para explicar, entre otras cosas, el ritmo del cambio o factores que dificultan los canales de gramaticalización o incluso llevan, aunque sólo sea aparentemente, a la inversión de las regularidades esperadas. El segundo paradigma teórico es el que trataremos aquí y que terminológicamente queremos etiquetar con el ya bastante generalizado término de tradiciones discursivas , no sin señalar que se pueden incluir, en este contexto, también otros estudios que prescinden de este término preciso pero que se refieren a fenómenos afines, en general, a la relación entre la historia de los textos (y la historia cultural en sentido más amplio, expresada y transmitida mediante textos) y la historia de la lengua. Contrario al punto de vista cognitivo, el estudio de las tradiciones discursivas de por sí es necesariamente externo, y en su caso la “necesidad” de relación con lo interno es justamente la contraria a la de los estudios cognitivos: es posible estudiar las tradiciones discursivas prescindiendo de la visión propiamente lingüística, por ejemplo, cuando se estudia la historia de un género literario (bajo aspectos puramente literarios), pero se pueden relacionar las tradiciones discursivas con evoluciones de la lengua, y creemos que no es sólo posible, sino prometedor y fructífero.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the emergence and evolution in Spanish of three verbal constructions that share the same form as the Spanish verbal periphrasis for expressing future time, namely, \&lt;ir a + infinitive\&gt; ‘to go + inf’. Specifically, those constructions are verbal periphrases expressing the past tense, the completive and focus values. The past periphrasis and the completive one share the same etymology as the future tense periphrasis: a construction in which the verb ir ‘to go’ expresses an advance in time. The omission of the indication of the place towards which the movement takes us will allow us to stop focusing on a destination in order to envisage the event expressed by the infinitive of the construction. On the other hand, the focus construction constitutes a further evolution of the completive periphrasis. From the 18th century onwards, the distribution of these three periphrases is the same as that of modern Spanish: the past periphrasis has disappeared from the language and the other two are maintained in contexts of communicative proximity.

While various fields have recognised the complexity and dynamism of human thought and behaviour, intra-individual variation has received less attention in regard to language acquisition, use and change. Linguistic research so far lacks both empirical and theoretical work that provides detailed information on the occurrence of intra-individual variation, the reasons for its occurrence and its consequences for language development as well as for language variation and change. The current issue brings together two subdisciplines – psycholinguistics and variationist sociolinguistics – in juxtaposing systematic and non-systematic intra-individual variation, thereby attempting to build a cross-fertilisation relationship between two disciplines that have had surprisingly little connection so far. In so doing, we address critical stock-taking, meaningful theorizing and methodological innovation.},

	abstract = {This paper hypothesizes that as an expression becomes more frequent in one grammatical context, its mental retrievability improves, which in turn makes it more easily available in different yet closely related (analogous) grammatical contexts. Such a mechanism can account for the progression of gradual change. The hypothesis generates two testable predictions. First, innovative constructions should be more likely to emerge if their analogical models are better entrenched. Second, an expression's retrievability can also be improved by priming, which in the short term should have a similar effect to entrenchment. These predictions are tested against the development of the noun key into an adjective (as in a very key argument). The change is gradual, starting with increased productivity of compounds with key as specifying element, leading later to debonded and clearly adjectival uses. The development of key is analyzed using data from the British Houses of Parliament. The effect of entrenchment is tested against individual variation. Next, situations are investigated where key has been primed, either by an earlier instance of key or by a collocate of key. The evidence supports the hypothesis. Innovative uses of key are favored under conditions that improve the retrievability of its more conventionalized uses.},

	abstract = {Although analogy has often been invoked as a mechanism for language change, its explanatory power remains controversial, mainly due to a lack of independent evidence for the workings of analogy in language change (Kiparsky 1974; Plag 2003; Fischer 2018). This PhD project aims to find precisely such evidence. It was hypothesized that analogical support influences how a change unfolds, meaning that analogy leaves traces behind. In a series of corpus studies, we investigated five potential traces of analogy, using a paradigm of deprepositional adnumerals (e.g. about in about twenty people attended the party (see also Plank 2004)). 
The first study demonstrated that analogy works within a construction, i.e. syntagmatic analogy (cf. Delbecque \& Verveckken 2014), as innovative syntactic environments resemble already established ones. In this way, analogy creates a gradual path of change guided by analogy (cf. De Smet 2016b), which is determined by global and local similarities. The second and third case studies focused on analogy between constructions, or paradigmatic analogy. We carried out a comparative study of the emergence of about, which as the first deprepositional adnumeral could not benefit from similarities to deprepositional adnumeral models, and over, which as a later emerging deprepositional adnumeral could build upon analogical support. This not only showed that analogical support makes a change go faster (cf. Verveckken 2016: 251n25), but also that changes benefiting from analogy do not rely on ambiguity as the trigger of change (Brems 2007; Aaron 2016; Verveckken 2016) . Rather, when there is analogical support, ambiguity acts as fuel for the change. Analogical change is facilitated because analogy acts as the bridge between convention and innovation.
The fourth and fifth study focused on the level of individual cognition, by investigating increased accessibility of analogical models. Since analogy frequently fails because retrieval of analogical models is challenging (Gick \& Holyoak 1980; Gentner \& Maravilla 2018), analogy can be facilitated when the analogical models are more accessible (De Smet 2016a; De Smet 2018). In the fourth study, we investigated how better entrenchment of analogical models boosts analogical innovation. A comparison of individuals revealed that speakers with better entrenched analogical models more frequently used the innovation, at least when the corpus material was sufficiently fine-grained and the innovation still very recent. The fifth study demonstrated that recent exposure of the analogical models, i.e. priming, boosted the use of the innovation, as long as it is a recent innovation.
In sum, this project found multiple traces of analogy in language change and hence provides evidence for the role of analogy in change. In this way, the importance of analogical links, or similarity associations, in organizing the cognitive network of linguistic knowledge is further confirmed. However, the studies show that not all similarity links are equally important, in that not all potential analogical models seem to affect how change unfolds. Future research could investigate when a similarity is strong enough to act as analogical model. Additionally, future research should investigate different changes to gather even more evidence of analogy in language change.

              Because they involve individual-level cognitive processes, psychological explanations of linguistic phenomena are in principle testable against individual behaviour. The present study draws on patterns of individual variation in corpus data to test explanations of productivity. Linguistic patterns are predicted to become more productive with higher type frequencies and lower token frequencies. This is because the formation of abstract mental representations is encouraged by varied types but counteracted by automation of high-frequency types. The predictions are tested for English -

              and 171 members of Parliament in the
              Hansard Corpus
              . Linear regression is used to model individual variation in productivity, in relation to type and token frequency, as well as several other predictor variables. While the expected effects are observed, there is also robust evidence of an interaction effect between type and token frequency, indicating that productivity is highest for patterns with many types and not-too-infrequent tokens. This fits best with a view of entrenchment as both a conservative and creative force in language. Further, some variation remains irreducibly individual and is not explained by currently known predictors of productivity.},

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

Led by Editor in Chief Rochelle Lieber and Associate Editors Sabine Arndt-Lappe, Antonio Fàbregas, Christina Gagné, and Francesca Masini, this collection includes 115 wide-ranging and in-depth articles, encompassing all aspects of morphology, such as morphological units, inflection, derivation, compounding, and formal morphological means. Contributors at the forefront of the field discuss the major theoretical debates and methodological approaches, exploring the interface between morphology and phonology, syntax, and semantics, along with psycholinguistic, neurolinguistics, and sociolinguistic issues. The final section of the encyclopedia presents illustrative sketches of the morphological systems of a wide range of language families, from Arawak and Dravidian to Sino-Tibetan and Indo-European, offering a wide range of cross-linguistic data that will be useful to both researchers and teachers.},

	abstract = {Questions about the development of the Romance future have engaged scholars since Thielmann's classic statement of 1885, yet a century later a number of the fundamental issues remain unresolved. Professor Fleischman suggests that this is in part due to the narrow sense in which the question has traditionally been formulated - as simply the history of the `future-tense' slot in the grammar - and in part the result of the investigative approach, which until recently has taken little account of important advances in general linguistics in the field of diachronic syntax. The present volume examines 'future' as a conceptual category and discusses the various strategies that have been used to map this conceptual category on to grammar in Romance. The data are taken in the main from Western Romance languages, particularly French, and frequent parallels are drawn with English. To account for the evolution of the future, Professor Fleischman proposes a network of interrelated, often cyclical developments in syntax and semantics, and seeks to place the individual diachronic events within a broader framework of syntactic typology and universal patterns of word-order change.},

Specifically, those constructions are verbal periphrases expressing the past tense, the completive and focus values. The past periphrasis and the completive one share the same etymology as the future tense periphrasis: a construction in which the verb ir ‘to go’ expresses an advance in time. The omission of the indication of the place towards which the movement takes us will allow us to stop focusing on a destination in order to envisage the event expressed by the infinitive of the construction. On the other hand, the focus construction constitutes a further evolution of the completive periphrasis. From the 18th century onwards, the distribution of these three periphrases is the same as that of modern Spanish: the past periphrasis has disappeared from the language and the other two are maintained in contexts of communicative proximity.

	abstract = {Homophony avoidance has often been claimed to be a mechanism of language change. We investigate this mechanism in Dutch by applying two strands of research – corpus studies and experimental data – to find support for claims based on earlier historical observations. Throughout the history of Dutch, homophony avoidance has been named as the cause of language change or inhibition of change on several occasions. We build on these historical observations with an experimental study and a corpus study on a synchronic Dutch alternation, where avoidance of homophony between present and past tense can appear. Plurals of verbs with a stem ending in a dental show homophony with the present when they are used in the preterite (compare zetten ‘put’ pst-pl with zetten ‘put’ prs-pl). This homophony can be avoided by using the perfectum (hebben gezet ‘have put’). A wug-style experiment shows that verbs with dental stem are indeed used significantly more in the perfectum in the plural than in the singular, while verbs without dental stem do not show this difference. A corpus study on Dutch further corroborates these results. Combined, these studies make a strong case for homophony avoidance as a plausible mechanism of language change.},

	abstract = {Usage-based linguistics abounds with studies that use statistical classification models to analyze either textual corpus data or behavioral experimental data. Yet, before we can draw conclusions from statistical models of empirical data that we can feed back into cognitive linguistic theory, we need to assess whether the text-based models are cognitively plausible and whether the behavior-based models are linguistically accurate. In this paper, we review four case studies that evaluate statistical classification models of richly annotated linguistic data by explicitly comparing the performance of a corpus-based model to the behavior of native speakers. The data come from four different languages (Arabic, English, Estonian, and Russian) and pertain to both lexical as well as syntactic near-synonymy. We show that behavioral evidence is needed in order to fine tune and improve statistical models built on data from a corpus. We argue that methodological pluralism is the key for a cognitively realistic linguistic theory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

It consists of a digitised collection of handwritten administrative texts (e.g. town council meeting reports), handwritten ego-documents (e.g. diaries and travelogues), and printed pamphlets (e.g. of a political or religious nature). The corpus is also balanced between northern and southern material, with data from the provinces of Holland and Zeeland for the North, and from Flanders and Brabant for the South. After having discussed its structure and composition, we will illustrate the value of the new corpus with a number of smaller case studies. Based on our experiences with the corpus, we will conclude by launching a plea for historical corpus building not to focus too much on the quantity of data (‘big data’), but rather shift attention to data quality.},

I give 25 examples of pairs of construction types, from a substantial range of grammatical domains. For some of them, the existing evidence from the world’s languages and from corpus counts is already strong, while for others, I know of no counterevidence and I make readily testable claims. I also discuss how the functional-adaptive forces operate in language change, and I discuss a number of possible alternative explanations.},

However, this learned source is not the source of the Modern Spanish personal infinitive in adjunct position. For the latter, an acquisitional scenario is put forward whereby changes in the primary linguistic data (cf. Lightfoot 1999) made adjunct personal infinitives possible.},

This article seeks to fill up this gap by contrasting the syntax of positive and negative causation, and particularly focuses on the case marking of the causee. The analysis of a Spanish corpus allows us to examine previous accounts of case marking, namely the hypothesis of incorporation and the related ‘Stratal Uniqueness Law’, and the theory of direct vs. indirect causation. The second part is dedicated to the question whether the cognitive-semantic characteristics of the causation models have any effect on its syntax. Finally, a multifactorial analysis, taking into account the degree of dynamicity of the constituents and the accusative or dative case of the causee, demonstrates that variation of pattern mainly depends on the rich polysemy of the main verbs.},

	abstract = {As shown by Kayne (1975), Romance causatives with faire fall into two classes, faire infinitif (FI) and faire par (FP). We argue from Italian data that the properties of the two classes depend on the nature of the complement of fare:FI embeds a vP, FP a nominalized VP. The syntactic and semantic characteristics of these complements account straightforwardly for well-known differences between FI and FP, including the previously untreated “obligation” requirement in FI, absent in FP. Our analysis also accounts for another subtle restriction on the formation of FP: the existence of an animacy requirement on the subject of fare, absent in FI. Finally, we argue that only FP can undergo passivization; this accounts for a previously unobserved asymmetry in passivizability of causatives of unergative and unaccusative intransitive verbs.},

We show that in Catalan and Italian and to some degree also French, in such contexts, the case realisation of the causee as accusative/dative depends on the transitivity of the next clause down. We call this effect, first discussed by Burzio (1986) for Italian, ‘restructuring for transitivity’. We then move our attention to the interaction between restructuring for transitivity and other restructuring and clause union phenomena such as clitic climbing and se deletion, and discuss several theoretical challenges posed by these interactions.},
