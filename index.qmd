## Vision

As a language student, I was often struck by the overwhelming number of exceptions that came with rules. I soon learned that languages exhibit a **gradient behaviour**, and rules can just capture the endpoints of a continuum of possibilities\
\
The core of my research on language variation and change focuses on the “unexplored middle ground” between what is certainly possible and what is highly unlikely or impossible. From a probabilistic perspective, speakers have a statistical knowledge driving their choice of alternative linguistic forms in subtle ways. I investigate all aspects influencing the **variation and the trajectories of language change**: human processing abilities, frequency patterns, contextual features, social and discourse-pragmatic conventions.
